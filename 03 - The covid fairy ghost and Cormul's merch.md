We argue on the way back to town. There is a lesson to be gained, I say, from dallying when we are to find a man. If we had hurried, we might have saved him! But we mined crystals, and took our time, and he was dead when we arrived. Not dead for long. My arguments fall on deaf ears, claims that we only went there to make money. I am grumpy. Smula understands.

Upon arriving in town, we notice there are more patrols than usual. Cormul speaks with the guards, asking what is going on. One guard says there is nothing for us to worry about. Cormul claims investments, hints at **bribes**. Heavily. That loosens the guard's tongue and he whispers "One of the councilmen of the city was found dead today." Cormul enquires "What is his name? I'd like to know if he was one of my **friends**". The social skills on this man… is this what my aunts tried to teach me? Maybe I should take notes. More notes.

**Syndar**. Cormul does not know him.

Krozzot knows him, possibly. (He fails his check so he gets 2 pieces of information, one correct, the other false.) Syndar dealt in **food and drink**, or he is the newest councilman who owned **many ships**. Krozzot is not sure which one it is.

We return to the tavern. Our **questgiver** should be here? Indeed he is here. His sorrows are very thoroughly drowned by now. Sevaris seems to think it's a mercy. I wonder if we can fish the man out of the alcohol. Sevaris thinks of casting a spell to un-drunk him, decides against it. We shake him, the drunk, not Sevaris. He does not look well at all, seems to remember us. Krozzot gives him the dead man's sword. Cormul says we avenged his friend. Then tries to turn in a profit by selling him the boss' breasplate. I slap him. He mutters something about "ruining my pitch". The questgiver is mourning, weeping "why, why". Thankfully unreceptive to Cormul's pitch. He grabs the sword and drags it with him, stumbling up the stairs.

"Dinner, anyone?" Cormul says cheerfully. I feel like there is something bitter on my tongue, like the time I ate mouldy cheese. There were regrets. I have regrets here too. Want to keep an eye on this man. He drank so much. He is so sad. Krozzot suggests sacrificing someone in a ritual to sober up the man. Cormul grumbles "you need a new hobby". Cormul orders us a feast to celebrate our first mission together. We eat, and he argues with Krozzot about money, dungeons, the Goddess of Hell, **Queen of Dis**. Side eyes all around the table. Krozzot suspects we ate all the potatoes while he was mining crystals.

RAT FLAG

We discuss **religion**. Cormul suspects me of being a cultist. Wobble is outside, he's not allowed in because he ate some chair legs and Cormul had to pay for them. Cormul disagrees. They should not have made the chair legs edible! What if they gave splinters to his radish boy. We discuss Sevaris' last name, which Krozzot is suspicious of. He's called **Silverwing** but his wings are blue! I explain that it's maybe like rats, sometimes a brown rat and a grey rat have lots of small rats, not all are brown or grey. Makes sense to them. We discuss **business** and how to only fleece customers, not employees, I mean partners.

"We need to keep all the vermin away, you know, both the crickets and the raaaaaaa… **radicalists**, we need to keep the radicalists away."

I try to find our questgiver's door and listen in, just checking if he is alive? I can't find his door, but Sevaris spots clues of one big sword being dragged across the floor. He peeps through the keyhole, looks like the man is sleeping in the bed. He casts **Message** on the guy in the bed; "Why did you leave me?" ~~Novator caught covid just so he could make a convincing rasping voice.~~ The man wakes with a start, panicked. Sevaris continues the deception, scaring the living daylight out of him.

I roll **Perception** to try and rat him out on using magic. I roll a natural 1. Don't even notice Sevaris giggling to himself. Maybe that cheese was mouldy? Smula in my pocket sure is sleepy. Ah the man is sobbing again, he was really good friends with the guy who died… Sevaris is mentally torturing the man with his ghost act. Now he is trying to tell the man to buy Cormul's breastplate. (Yeeeesssss buy my merch!!) Sevaris flies away smiling. I compliment him for checking on the man, making sure he is well, what a good fairy he is.

We go to sleep.

The next morning, Sevaris and Cormul discuss business and selling the breastplate. As we eat breakfast, our man walks to us. He says he didn't sleep well. He apologises for his drunkenness yesterday, confirms his friend's passing. He asks to buy the breastplate. Cormul bargains. I kick him under the table. Hope Krozzot is not like _these two_. Cormul AND Sevaris fleece the mourning man and sell the breastplate **170 gold**. He leaves to get the money; in the meantime Sevaris tells him of what he did at the door last night.

My brain goes silent. I look into my pocket at Smula, and start conversing with her in the Ysoki language. I do not know these people. Cormul gives each of us 40 gold, and 50 to Sevaris for his mastermind scam. I accept the money. Reluctantly. It will go to my family, when I find them. They do not need to know. They will need to eat.

We head to the **market** because the boys want to do further business. I follow grumpily. Maybe I find rumours about my family? Smula is napping in my pocket, full of cheese from last night's feast. Sevaris looks for alchemy supplies. Krozzot tags along to sell his **bloodstone**. Sevaris finds a **gnome alchemist**, and asks for **potion recipes**. For healing potions, antidote, alchemist's fire, and a poison to coat blades. And cheese elixir? The gnome says he will look into it, has not heard of it.

(Novator reads us a description, it's real, allows you to command cheeses. I'll command cheeses to pile up on my plate… Quain says if I eat too much, then Novator can control ME. Like bloodbending but worse. Cheesebending.)

Cormul looks for **adventurers**, so we go to a magic items shop. He approaches a group of adventurers and starts chatting with them. He is spinning a yarn. I let him cook, add in some spice. I nod at all the right moments. Trying to sell the **mines** he picked up in the dungeon. Our man Quain RPs a natural 20 in Persuasion. He does not roll. He only talks. The adventurers are super convinced, and buy, and pay up. Cormul buys handwraps from the shop, I say I want to buy a **notebook** and a pen. Need to take notes of his business strategy. My aunts will be proud. Cormul talks to the shopkeeper real good, we get the notebook for free.

We go look for a **quest board**. More jobs, more money, more cheese. The **merchants' board** is the high-risk, well-paying jobs; the **church board** has less risky quests, but the rewards are lower.

We find 4 quests at the merchants' board:

- one close, up in the mountains, about sentient rocks and minerals
    
- one a bit farther, north-east towards Krazek, about elementals
    
- two far south, in the Aerinth jungle; one involves feral animals, the other involves heavily armoured undead
    

At the church board, we find 3 quests:

- one nearby to the north-west, that involves traps
    
- one a little farther at the foot of the Black Mountains up north, something about a friendly dwarf
    
- one across the lake on the northern shore of the Aerinth Jungle, "seems empty"?
    

I mention my family and my wish to look for them. We agree to spend another day at Port Leon, allowing me to search for an **Ysoki community** and clues to my scattered family. The rest of the party will prepare and ask around, gather information about the dungeons and potential threats.

Krozzot looks into renting a **boat** to cross the lake. It's 35 gold to buy a small boat. Cormul spends time looking for a better deal. Sevaris cooks up potions. Krozzot learns to pilot a boat (That's what it's called? Pilot? Rat paws are not made for water…).

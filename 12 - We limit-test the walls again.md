We return to our ship without any trouble, surprisingly. Now it's Krozzot's turn to find the way, so I sit and look at the Elixir of Cheese with great fascination. We spend the night on the boat as the journey to the next dungeon takes about **12 hours** in total, 8 of those on the water. Nothing bad happens during the night. Krozzot catches 8 fishies. Cormul wants fancy food so I cook up a fish soup with **cheese**. He is surprised he likes it, and we talk about the philosophy of being rats, and cheese.

We set out for the dungeon, I get us lost, we end up at a big **crater**. Maybe made by a meteorite? Cormul says he maybe sees something at the centre and it smells like money. Sevaris agrees meteors usually contain rare **minerals**. I suggest tying a rope to Sevaris and sending him down as a scout, but it gets ruled out as all our ropes combined won't be long enough. Krozzot just hops in and starts descending by standing on a slab of rock and skating down. Sevaris flies up high, folds his wings, and FALCON DIVES in.

At the bottom of the crater we find… a **blue crystal rod**, as high as Krozzot is tall. Krozzot had no idea about the rod. Sevaris shoots past Krozzot, stops right in front of the rod, and casts **Detect Magic**. It is indeed magical. I trip on my tail, tumble down the slope and end up on my bum, dizzy. After getting up I take a look at the rod, hoping to recognise craftsmanship or style… but it doesn't look like it's been **made**. I assume it either fell from the sky just like this, or grew from the ground.

Cormul grumbles to make way and let him handle things. Wobble gives it a **lick** and does not die. Cormul commands him to lick it again and uses his ability to share the radish's **senses**. He reports it tastes like dirty rubber, concludes it tastes like money, and requests assistance pulling it out and loading it on Wobble. They start talking about **selling** me to the dragon. We don't even know if there is a dragon… Cormul promises they'd steal me back. Why would a dragon want to buy a rat anyway? "As a snack," Krozzot says.

Krozzot says he is an expert at fighting **inanimate** **objects**. Sevaris wants to touch the crystal, which means **set it on fire** "to loosen it". We settle on having Wobble pull out the crystal rod from the ground. He does not manage. I try to help, but my arms are full of soft cheese. Cormul tries, but no progress is being made at all. Sevaris lands on top of the rod and pulls! But only a little fart comes out and the crystal does not budge, predictably.

Krozzot steps in and gives the crystal a glare for good measure. He does **nudge** it a little bit, but it's still stuck. Wobble is the strongest of us all, so we latch him to the crystal and dangle a **wheel of cheese** in front of him for motivation. We manage to tilt the crystal a bit. I ask **Smula** to push it, but she is still a rat, if a well-fed rat. Krozzot and Wobble put their backs into it! The crystal rod comes loose, and Cormul catches it so it doesn't hit the ground, then carefully attaches it to Wobble.

With Cormul's **Guidance**, Krozzot examines the rod again. It does come from space! The material can be used in machinery, possibly? But this particular rod is really **high-quality** and must be expensive.

I find the path to the dungeon this time, and we start searching for the **entrance**. Krozzot immediately finds a circle of coins on the floor, linked by a thread. The loot goblins want to pick it up and as Cormul tries, he disappears into the dungeon. We all follow, mumbling about the dangers of **greed**.

Cormul prepares his bumhole by casting **Mystic Armor** and **Summoner's Precaution**. It smells stale and musty in here, hmmm that delicious dungeon fragrance. Sevaris squeeze through a crack in the stone he should absolutely NOT have been able to fit through, and gets yeeted back by the cosmic powers.

We find a lonely **lamp**, lit a pretty yellow. A place where a door once was, with the door nowhere to be seen. On either side of the corridor we appeared in, passages have collapsed and are filled with **rubble**. We go through the doorless doorframe and find a big container in a room. We open it and are met with the stench of rotting corpses. The south wall of the room is gone, and a chasm yawns at our feet. Eek… I step back.

We go north to a room filled with dilapidated crates, barrels, and broken jars. A **throne** sized for a large creature like a giant sits in the middle of the room, but it has been smashed to pieces. I examine the broken furniture, looks **dwarven**-made. Going through empty corridors and halls, we find a very large **desk** with another lamp burning on it. A large, ruined sofa rots in a corner. Facing the desk is a **statue** of some kind of robed spellcaster. Krozzot knows exactly who the statue represents; a protective figure of spellcasters, but its power is **inactive**. The room contains many cages, all empty and clean.

Krozzot takes a closer look at the **cages** while Sevaris and me explore a long corridor. We find a circular room containing a deep pit filled with water, a lone lamp standing next to it. We find another **pool**, this one rectangular in a smaller room. Well that's relative, it's still a pretty big room but I'm small, so… Wobble wades into the pool and his leaves stick through the surface, so someone my size will have to swim. On the far wall is some kind of lever; Cormul uses **Mage** **Hand** to tie a rope around it, and pulls. The water drains, then more water flows in from a hole in the wall. A huge sink? Or a giant toilet. Hmmmm.

We search the place, making theories about who or what could live here. Maybe a **serpent**-shaped dragon? We find a strangely shaped room close to the entrance; it looks like it once had **windows**, and they've been covered up.

We find a room full of **treasure**!! But we're not alone… We see a small dragon-like creature, and a man who looks exactly like the boss of our very first dungeon. "So anyway, I started looting." - Cormul. Overwhelming **greed** takes over him and he spends every second picking up gold. The man had clearly noticed us, but said nothing. The tiny dragon seems passive.

We walk up and speak to the man in armour. He says he has never seen rats like us before. I say he was a ratcist the first time too! "You must have met one of the other me's," he says. Krozzot gets philosophical about it. I ask why he calls us rats, he says we are "lower creatures". Krozzot tries to ask what he is then, but in this moment Sevaris lobs a vial of **Alchemist Fire** at him. Well, initiative time boys.

I shoot a fire arrow at the man in armour. Cormul looks up from the gold just long enough to be pissed off someone is interfering with his looting, and sends **Wobble** to the front lines. The man in armour says "That's why I called you rats. Enjoy my dragon, I will be leaving now." and he makes a **portal**, steps through, and disappears. Sevaris commands his own pet rat, summoned from the rat **statuette**, to bite the dragon. Then he casts… **Final Sacrifice**. The rat explodes in a burst of ice.

Ruka sees the AC of the dragon; 20! Krozzot slices the dragon into ribbons with his returning chakram. The dragon roars! The statue behind him starts to glow and fires a beam on the dragon, casting **Enlarge**. The now larger dragon goes to eat his vegetables, but Wobble dodges like no one else, and all three attacks miss. I mark the dragon as my prey, shoot him, shockingly hit twice with **Hunted Shot**, and command Smula to retreat.

The statue **heals** the dragon to full, and the beam of light winks out. Cormul frightened the dragon with his **Demon Mask**, but he is taking the damage intended for Wobble and he's looking pretty rough. Sevaris casts **Telekinetic Projectile** to chuck another Alchemist's Fire and… CRITICAL! Then Krozzot does big damage too.

The dragon is not happy and breathes **poison** on Krozzot and Cormul. The Halfling falls unconscious, and Wobble wilts from existence. It lands a critical tail hit on Krozzot, but the beast is still on fire… and it collapses from the burning damage. Krozzot heals up Cormul, then himself. ~~Bingus~~. Sevaris is trying to peel some **scales** off the dragon. Krozzot is slicing up Cormul as he failed his **Risky Surgery**. Sevaris is not doing great with the peeling and gets only 2 scales.

Cormul resumes **looting** and I join him with great enthusiasm. The dungeon… is not closing. Well, more gold for us! Krozzot supposes the armoured man **teleported** to another room in the dungeon. As I am scooping up gold, I spot the hilt of a **longsword**, with smoke emanating from it. I grab it but have no idea what it does. Krozzot identifies it as a **Smoking Sword**. Pretty neat but it's too heavy for me. I scoop up **3000 gold** besides. Cormuls picks up some kind of diving suit.

Sevaris goes mad with **greed**, overfilling his bags and pockets, so I lasso him again and try to drag him away. He's too heavy to fly with all this gold so I just drag him across the floor like an angry chihuahua. We **leave** the dungeon and we all feel much lighter, except Krozzot who feels the same, on account of not having looted like a goblin. All the gold we looted disappears…

We're going to close this dungeon then. Somehow. Then go to the other crater marked on the map south of here, then to **Kratin**? There is the dungeon west of the **Ice Fields** we could look into; but maybe we can find more adverts for dungeons in Kratin.

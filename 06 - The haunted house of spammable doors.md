Sevaris is looking for new potion recipes. For Healing Potion (moderate), Alchemist's Fire (moderate), and Cheetah's Elixir (moderate)! That sounds both great and terrifying, it does. He snoops around town in search for the elusive recipe to the **Elixir of Cheese**. No luck. He spends a good chunk of the night brewing.

They want to eat my rat again. I let Smula hide in my pocket as I explain, with patience and passion, that rats are friends, not food. Sevaris insists he can roast a rat with the Alchemist's Fire. Absolutely not! Our next plan is to go to the **Friendly Dwarf** dungeon. Krozzot asks if we have a can opener. To open the dwarf's armour. To… what? Cormul mutters that he is surrounded by evil people.

The next morning, we set out with me **scouting** ahead of the party. Smula helps. She is a good rat. We follow the road to Krazek as far as we can, then head **north**. We share the road with travellers and merchants. Cross-country, we encounter no threats and make it to the spot we marked on our map. From Port Leon, it's a long walk, a good **8 hours**. We left early in the morning and arrive there in the early afternoon. We search the area for the dungeon. Krozzot point out a small **window** in a tree. There is no door in that particular tree.

I suggested politely knocking, but the boys decide to just go in. Barbarians! We pass through and arrive in a stone fortress kind of place, a staircase leading further in. At the top of the stairs is a big gate standing open. A **dwarf** is standing by one of the walls. Cormul happily greets him. The dwarf says he lives here, and the place just cleans itself. He knows it's a dungeon, but it's his place now.

"Let me guess. No taxes?" - "Of course not, it's a dungeon!"

Cormul pulls us aside to discuss a **tax-free**, possibly also dwarf-free future. I take notes.

The dwarf's name is **Grung**. Sevaris enquires about his family. Grung says he wanted money, and left his family, cutting them off. Sevaris casts **Message** to tell Cormul "So he is alone…" Oh dear. Krozzot confirms it's unusual for a dwarf to do this, but not unheard of. Cormul asks if Grung gets a lot of adventurers. There have been, a week or two ago. They looked around. Grung says we're free to look around too. Cormul says racist things about dwarves and stonework, asks for a guided tour.

The **fountain** is not made of cheese. Wobble checked. We pass through the fountain courtyard. Grung says he'll be in the stables. There are no horses, but it's still stables. He warns us about **ghosts** upstairs.

"All scammers are friendly, that's how they operate!" Cormul.

I point out that Cormul, too, is friendly. He does not deny.

In the entrance hall sits a **throne**, split cleanly in twain. Cormul sits on it, one cheek on each half. Looks like that cut was done a while ago. How long? Uh-huh. Not recent. The hall is lined with pillars and lamps, and by the walls are well-carved statues. Sevaris opens a door in the west wall. We go into a series of richly appointed, comfortable rooms. On a chest of drawers stand some **egg-like objects**. Wobble eats one, thinking it's an avocado. Nobody thinks it was an avocado. There are dragon trophies in that room… did Wobble eat a dragon egg?! The other two eggs seem unscathed. Sevaris grabs one, Krozzot the other. Comul requests they keep those far away from Wobble.

On the east side, Cormul and me find a **dining room**, equally opulent. The door in the south wall leads to a kitchen. Cheese spotted! I swipe it. South of the kitchen, a corridor. Like on the west side, it has a spiral staircase leading up. South, the stables. Even they are spotless, like the rest of the dungeon. Another corridor leading south. Scary… I'm not going on my own. Neither is Smula. Cormul inspects the radishes in the kitchen, shrugs. "Mine is bigger."

We go south. **Barracks** like for a guard! We start thinking the dwarf is lying to us, he can't be living here alone. In the library is a massive spiral staircase. Krozzot "rescues" some books, to help them get to the library. Seems like books about magic? Cormul wants to "jump the dwarf in the stables" because only one person should get to live tax-free.

We go to the **stables**, where Cormul re-grows Wobble. Krozzot asks Grung how he re-lights all the lamp. He says it's magical, the lamps stay lit all the time, the place also cleans itself overnight. Cormul tries to distract him, with the intent on jumping him. While Grung is checking some crates, Cormul sends Wobble on him. The radish **murders** the dwarf, leaving him to bleed out draped over a crate. I am in a party of savages…

"Oh cabbages! No Wobbles, do not the cabbages."

Krozzot shows his books to Sevaris. Incomplete research on fire magic, or magical traps. Northwest in the courtyard, we find stairs leading down. Sevaris casts **Produce Flame** on the torch in the bracket. Cormul is impressed. Sevaris is very proud of himself.

Ruka is falling asleep so we will explore the basement in the next episode!

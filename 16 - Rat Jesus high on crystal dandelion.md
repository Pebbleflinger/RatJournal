We return to **Kratin** while discussing cheese, which is my understanding of shareholders and service providers. I'd like more shares of the cheese wheel thank you. Sevaris is still a criminal in Kratin so we ponder selling him out, to which he replies "I'll **Fireball** you all!" Sevaris disguises himself as a balloon which I hold so he doesn't fly away. Not the first time I've had the tiny wizard on a leash, either. There are wanted posters for Sevaris at the city gates, 100 gold reward for information. My balloon is deflating and inflating very grumpily at that.

We discuss how to milk the police for money without putting ourselves at risk; the poster isn't too detailed so it could be any fairy with a bit of blue on them. We first go to the markets to sell the **shark skin** I peeled from the long shark. I squeeze 150 gold from the merchant for both skins, with a bit of bargaining, while sweating from the proximity of the criminal balloon. Channelling my inner Cormul, who steps in to help Krozzot sell more shark skin.

With our shark skins combined and a bit of difficult math, each party member earns **52 gold and 5 silver**. Cormul is proud of me, I am happy with not being a criminal (yet) but Sevaris in the balloon mutters I am a criminal, because I'm hiding him.

We head to our friend **Axe**'s home, who we met on our travels. We suspect he has a **Big Fucking Crystal** like ours. We get to a cozy little cottage on the outskirts of town and knock, but there is no response. There is a tap at the window, a little cat trying to get out. I assume it's just Axe's pet being silly but Cormul steps to the window and attempts to converse with the cat. It does not go well, as anticipated.

The boys overthink the hell out of this and as I am looking to try and discern the cat's gender, spying for nuts, Sevaris casts Detect Magic, his balloon wheezing and glowing. He sees a trace of magic on the cat and decides to cast **Dispel Magic** on the poor little kitty. The cat says in Taldane "Can you get me out of here?" Cormul is looking at the cat with a signature look of superiority, he was right about the cat. Sevaris claims it's the government, the cat says the balloon is right.

We ask our friendly fish guy what he thinks and he agrees we should help the cat. I try to be sneaky, look for a way around the house, a back door that's maybe not in plain view… Sevaris is tripping balloons and feeling he is being watched by everyone. I pass the balloon to Krozzot and pick the lock. I ask the cat for his name and he is called **Puss**, poor thing… We ask him if he wants to tag along with us and he says nah, he'll just go into the forest and chill. If we want to see something neat, we can follow him so we follow the weird cat into the forest.

Puss says he lives with Axe, but he wants to go relax in the forest. Axe hasn't been home in a few days, forgot to let Puss out, so Cormul says we should play a prank on Axe, like hiding one of his belongings. Puss says "don't worry, I've already pissed on his bed". We discuss cleaning the piss and taking the crystal for payment, then creating an insurance company (makes sense). The forest is still within the bounds of the city and Puss leads the way to a hidden hollow. A lake fills the space, a small island close to the shore is mostly occupied by a twisting tree. Off to our left, we spot the **dungeon symbol** carved into a rock…

We are very intrigued by the dungeon but don't want to risk closing it by accident. Krozzot suggests killing the cat, we all call him names. Puss runs off… on the lake water. WHAT. I try to follow him and discover I am **RAT JESUS**. Sevaris takes the credit as I am holding his balloon again. Wobble manages to drink the water all while standing on it. Smula still squeaks at me and hasn't learnt Taldane like Puss has, maybe just a matter of time.

We ask our **fishy friend** if he can dive and check the underwater area, he goes for a dive and hits the surface face first, unable to get through. Performance problems? Sevaris asks. We consider maybe the animal people of Kratin all come from here? We ask Puss and he says only a few animals like squirrels come through here. We also ask why Puss had a spell cast on him to prevent him from speaking, but he doesn't know and thinks it happened while he was asleep, before Axe left.

We get Puss' permission to let our Sahagin friend stay in the area, and I try to climb the big tree. The rest of the party argues about whether city taxes would apply to this dungeon. The view from the top of the tree is really pretty! But I don't discover anything new so I climb down and we investigate the island. Krozzot and Cormul spot tree roots acting odd, as if opening into an entrance. Sevaris concludes the tree has a blow hole and we enter a spiralling wooden staircase. At the bottom, a stump sits in the middle of a circular room and a tall **flower** with crystalline petals grows from the stump.

Everyone is looking at the flower wondering what it could be; I just go and sniff it. It smells wonderful and soothing. Sevaris suspects it's a powerful **alchemical ingredient** and wants to pick it, but we fear it will close the dungeon. It also doesn't look like the flower would grow outside of this dungeon. Krozzot considers cutting off a piece for grafting and looks for seeds. We think the flower might be like a dandelion and a gust of wind would scatter the petals. There are a lot of petals, tightly packed, we estimate over a hundred. If we just take a dozen, everything should be fine?

Sevaris harvests 5 petals while Krozzot wonders how to grow a new plant from those seeds. Cormul says we should buy this piece of land to make some kind of money off the flower, open a spa or something. It's getting late, so we decide to spend the night in the dungeon because it's peaceful here. Sevaris casts **Cozy Cabin** then puts up an **Alarm** spell.

We level up to 6?! How generous!

Next up we will try to buy this plot of land with the dungeon, try to figure out the crystal rod's value, maybe try to get a pardon for Sevaris? Otherwise we can find our boat and sail back to **Port Leon**. We are also looking for a good place to plant our crystal lotus seeds. We can also investigate the dungeons north and west of Port Leon, those marked "Church" and "Traps".

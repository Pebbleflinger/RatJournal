We make our way to the pit. Sevaris casts Light on a rock, chucks it down. We don't see it hit the bottom… So it's minimum 120 feet deep. We don't have a rope that long. Sevaris is out of spell slots. We could tie ropes together to make a longer one. We find a dilapidated hanging **bridge**. Sevaris takes 2 **ropes**, ties them on either side. Hmmm. It's easy for a flying one. I go first, I'm lightweight. The bridge sways, the planks creak… Sweat… But I make it.

Krozzot creeps along the bridge. Scarily, but he makes it. Cormul and Wobble manage, but some planks break off. We eventually get to a small ruined house. We follow twisted, ruined corridors. Krozzot finds a skeleton with a pouch. He even looks into the pouch and finds ~~covid fairy dust~~ an ancient coin and a **game set**. Wobble slurps more holy water, presumably.

We come to a **caved-in tunnel**, blocking the way. Another one. We could maybe dig. Looks like it'll take a while. Let's leave it to the diggers, Cormul says. We're lost… We cross the rope bridge again, using our own ropes for safety. It's all relative, the safety is. I have no trouble, being a lightweight rat (even after the recent cheese consumption). Cormul and Wobble follow across the bridge. Krozzot goes last, and more planks break off. Sevaris gets our ropes back.

We return to the pit in the ground. It's wide enough for any of us. Sevaris flies down to scout with **Light** rocks, to measure depth. In the meantime we tie **knots** in our ropes to climb down, and more importantly, to climb up again afterwards. It's about 150 feet down, water at the bottom. We don't know how deep the water is. Not deep enough to break a long fall, for sure. We climb down, Sevaris lighting the way for us. Me first with Smula in my pocket, then Cormul and Wobble, Krozzot last.

The Yoink Demon steals us. At the bottom is water and a cave entrance. The water isn't deep, 10 feet? Wobble goes for the starfish at the bottom, eating them. I hear an animal roar inside the cave. Krozzot and me tilt our heads. Sounds like a **crocodile**? ~~Crocs roar in this world~~. Krozzot says, do not let the croc into the water, fight it on land. Cormul says we should drown the crocodile. Sevaris sets up an **Alchemist fire** to catapult at the croc. It's a narrow tunnel, but we get ready to fight! It's a **Crocolisk**! ~~Whatever that is~~.

Sevaris opens up with **Telekinetic Projectile** and chucks his bomb at the croc. So that's how all those cave-ins happened. He sets the croc on fire, big damage! I Hunt it, aim with my bow, and miss. Smula runs to scratch it, also misses.

"You don't know if the crocodile has vegan wife!" - Ruka

This croc is not vegan, it tries to hit Smula. She takes one hit, does not enjoy that, dodges the other hits. The croc is still on fire. Cormul **protects** Wobble, who slaps the croc with his leaves. Grass is super effective against water, right? One hit but low damage, welp. Krozzot chucks Chakri, one hits and the croc is **off-guard**. Sevaris casts **Purifying Icicle**. Was he not out of spells a moment ago…? Not that he would ever lie about that, Sevaris is a good boy. Femboy. Fairy.

I shoot! The Arrow of Destiny! Right in the eye! The croc dies! I run to Smula and scoop her up, my poor girl is hurt. Krozzot tries to heal her, nearly kills her. Not proficient in rat medicine. Sevaris feels bad, and feeds a lesser **Healing Potion** to my rat. She's all better! I go to skin the croc for more handbag material. As I work, I see loot in its mouth! A **Necklace of Knives** and **Triangular Teeth** ~~it's a decal~~. I give the Teeth to Krozzot, as he pilots the boat.

Deeper inside the cavern is the croc's lair, full of skeletons. We loot the place. We have a **ratcist** discussion, Cormul claiming I should have understood the bear because we're "both fluffy". He is small and he understands Krozzot! I grumble. We climb back up our ropes. The walls are… wobbling. "Wobble, stop it immediately!" Is the dungeon closing? What happens if the dungeon closes while we are still inside? Asking for a friend. Krozzot thinks on the question. Opinions differ; get spat out, or die. Let's not take chances. We make for the exit.

We exit the dungeon; the door moves weirdly, like wobbling in the wind. We wait and see. "Surely it won't explode," Cormul says. Krozzot and me check for tracks of big animals nearby. Eventually the door just **disappears**. We find tracks. T-REX?! We discuss skinning it. We'd need to _kill_ it first. I suggest we get the hell out of here instead. We could always come back with poison.

We leave. Full speed ahead. Make it back to the **boat**. "It's aboat time," Cormul says. Krozzot doesn't want to sail at night, don't blame him. Cormul argues. I side with Krozzot. We fish, and decide to set sail on the morning. Krozzot catches 20 **fish**! I humbly ask for fish, Smula asks too. Cormul sulks. We eat half the fish. We sleep aboard the boat, and spend an uneventful night. We have good wind and nice weather on the way back. We park the ship (you say "park" for ships, yes?), greet the old man. We go report to the **merchant's guild** that we cleared the dungeon.

We go sell the **skins** I sliced from animals we killed. We go to a leatherworker. Cormul suggests **market study** first. Shit, I'm in. I pose as a customer, ask for a crocodile purse. There is not a lot of quality crocodile going around, it seems. Adventurers usually damage the skins. Cormul and I create artificial demand for croc. Then he goes to sell the skins. Pristine condition, near mint. Still has that strong crocodile smell, just give it a whiff, good stuff. The lady shopkeeper inspects the snake skins and the bear skins and crocodile skins. Takes out her abacus, she's a civilised person. She offers **78 gold** for all of it. Cormul bargains, rounds up the price to **80 gold**.

Krozzot and Sevaris go to the curiosities shop. They are greeted by a metallic… looking… man? The store is full of odds and ends. Sevaris offers the **Ceremonial shortsword with spinels**, sells it for 20 gold. Krozzot sells the game set and the bone drinking glass (a glass made of bone, not a glass for drinking bone…). He also puts the small chrysocolla up for sale. All goes for **30 gold**. Sevaris asks if he has the elusive recipe for the Elixir of cheese, sadly the man does not deal in these things. Sevaris browses the shop for interesting things.

"We should keep Nori away from the flea market." - "There is a reason I carry soap in my backpack!"

Sevaris finds a **statuette of a rat**. It stands out, we rodents usually do, yes indeed! Apparently it turns into a rat! The shopkeeper never managed to make it work. If Sevaris can make it work, he can have it! Sevaris had no idea. But he knows I am rat. So he asks to buy it. 35 gold, it's steep… He tries to bargain. They bargain hard! Sevaris buys it for **23 gold**.

Cormul buys 2 **Property Runes** for Krozzot (striking and returning) so he can slot them into his Chakram (**155 gold**). In exchange, Krozzot is to keep feeding fish to Wobble. Krozzot distributes some of his Chakri because he now has a ~~boomerang~~ returning chakram.

Cormul and me go to a bowyer to get my short bow **upgraded**. Cormul puts up a show to get it cheaper than market price. The man is not impressed, sighs and agrees. My bow has a +1! Always follow Cormul's role. Stick to the story. He gives me a **Writing Set** so I can take notes. Next time, he teaches me how to screw the police. First the police, then tax evasion! Gasp.

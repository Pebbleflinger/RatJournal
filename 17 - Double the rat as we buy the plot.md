Smula had a massive growth spurt during the night and is now big and strong! I hop on her back and we do a little victory lap on the water around the island. We leave the dungeon while Cormul is trying to **get Big Smula to speak Taldane**, with negative success. Sevaris turns back into a balloon so he doesn't get arrested and I drag him around again. We go back to Axe's house, but he is still absent so we make our way to the seat of power in Kratin.

We are lost boys and not criminals (nothing weird about my balloon) so we go ask a random guard for **directions** while Cormul talks about Krozzot's colour, his digger friends, and the perks of undead workers. Turns out we need to be invited into the government building and "the path shows up". Hmmm. If we can climb up the hill, we will also be let in. **Invitations** from the city lord will get us into the building. We can also get a temporary invite, so Cormul requests one "for business", as we want to purchase a piece of land.

Cormul claims "our rat fell in love with the city" (both rats thank you) and we want to stay here. The guard does some "anime hand signs" and we are granted passage up the hill! The trees bend as we approach, revealing a stone path up the hill. That's really fancy, we discuss the magic and Krozzot says he could probably do the same with enough sacrifices. We arrive in a big courtyard where soldiers are training and **siege engines** prompt a whole discussion as to their purpose. Of course a catapult can be used defensively, depends who's attacking too.

The soldiers direct us to the big building where the doors open automatically. I don't get told to leave my rat out so I proudly ride Smula into the building. We turn left and find a man at a desk, whom Cormul asks about purchasing a plot of land on Kratin's territory. He waves his hand, and the tabletop turns into a map. We're asked to point at the spot we want and… bingo! The forest bit where the **dungeon** is hasn't been bought by anyone yet. Cormul points at other plots first; it's untreated land so it shouldn't be terribly pricey. The plot we want is **500 gold**. I want to move into a world with this kind of housing market… Though if we want to build a house or a shop, there will be extra taxes to pay.

Cormul enquires about **access routes**, whether other buyers could lock us out of our plot. There are regulations in place to prevent that, and if necessary a public road could be built but that also means taxes. Alternatively we could build the road ourselves. Taxes are static if we open a business, and it would be 1% of plot price the first year, and it increases to 15% the next year depending on the business. Cormul asks, purely hypothetically, how to remove a **bounty** placed on a person's head. My balloon seems to whisper…

"Taldane motherfcker do you speak it?!" - Mr Quain, as Mr Ruka does not manage to switch chat back to common.

We count our gold, consider popping the balloon so maybe more gold falls out? We might be a bit short, depends if they take ancient gold, seems like they do. It's still most of our funds so we get asked if we want to take a **loan**. I don't think I've ever seen Cormul this close to a heart attack. "Buddy I do the loans," he says. We all pitch in with **125 gold** while giving Sevaris the side eye. And we buy the plot! *gasp* We're landlords now! Does that mean our alignment switches to evil? Are we considered "unholy"?

We decide to wait until deciding whether we are building a road or paying for government to build a public road. We have **1 week** to decide, Cormul asks about recommandations for builders. We all get distracted cracking horrible jokes, which I will have the decency to not write down here, for the sake of your sanity dear reader. We consider the access route to our plot and get told if we buy the adjacent 2 pieces of land we would get a discount and pay **650 gold** for both pieces, and then we won't need to build a road. We'll think on it.

We receive the **deed** to our piece of forest, and Cormul enquires about where to resolve legal issues. We talk about pointy wizard hats on the way and our DM buys a wizard hat IRL off the Amazon ladies. We go over to the police station and decide Krozzot will stay outside with the balloon, just in case. I leave Big Smula with them and follow Cormul and Tony inside.

"Well you see, one of my friends did an oopsie with the law, he is still a friend unfortunately, how do I unbounty the bounty?" Cormul asks the policeman officer. Basically we need to prove Sevaris is **harmless**… yeah… We'll give it a try…? We are asked to be **tested with magic** to make sure we are telling the truth. Cormul and me agree, though I'm very impressed and he is wiping off a couple litres of sweat. We are led into an interrogation room. First time? Yes in fact…

A dude comes in and tells us he will cast a spell on us. Cormul says he maybe has allergies, but his concerns are brushed aside. We are asked if Sevaris ever killed **innocent people**. N-not that we know of. They weren't innocent. Anyways. Why did he fly around town with a fire spell active? Uh… he's a little unstable. We try to keep him company so this kind of thing doesn't happen. Is Sevaris a **cultist**? Nope. Nope he is not, we have a cultist and it's not the fairy. Was he in contact with anyone in this town in the last week? Yes, we were here, browsing stores before "the incident".

Another clerk comes in and confirms we did not lie, so the bounty will be removed. We are advised to be careful, as there is a cult making trouble these days. We ask for details; the cultists call themselves **Flame**. When we leave the building, we find Krozzot hugging Big Smula for emotional support while still holding Balloonaris. We catch them up on what happened inside and try to explain to Sevaris to BEHAVE… all while avoiding any mention of Flame, because Cormul fears our wizard will join them.

I suggest looking for dungeons so we can start replenishing our funds with loot. Turns out this is also handled by the police, so we walk right back in. Krozzot looks sad as he wonders if our **boat** is okay. Yeah we have not seen our fair vessel in a while… The dungeon listings in Kratin are not public; the guard uses them for combat training. We manage to get information on one dungeon which has not been checked yet, so we're going at our own risk. And it's in the **Ice Fields**… Brrrrr… If we do end up going, we'll have to keep the guard updated so they don't send soldiers there.

We talk about Axe, and the bottle he gave Cormul. We have no idea what is inside… if only someone could tell us, eh. I take a look, take a sniff, ah yes **Spiderfoot Brew**. Made of actual spiders. Krozzot sets off to search for a builder named Bob and finds a humble shop called **Bob's Carpentry**. We don't have money to build just yet so we discuss what to build in the first place. The boys still want to sell rats and I am in sheer despair. Krozzot tries to convince Cormul to sell bits of Wobble instead. The halfling grumbles that if Wobble could make Wobblets, he would not be needed.

We finally manage to overrule Cormul on the rat business and discuss trying to grow the crystal flower in the dungeon. First we need to hide the dungeon's entrance so nobody wanders in, so we go to Bob's Carpentry and ask how much it would cost to build a **barn or stable** for our companions… Wobble the radish and Big Smula the suddenly fat rat. For **150 gold** it can be done in 3 days! Krozzot shuffles off to the city's library to research botany, hoping to find clues on how to grow more of the crystal flower. He also finds a book on **large-scale rituals**… Krozzot-what-are-you-reading. He borrows the book and promises to return it within the week. The orc also researches the crystal rod, muttering to himself.

Next time:

We want to **explore our dungeon** and ensure it doesn't close, build the **barn**, and once it's done, leave for the **Ice Fields** to hopefully get some dungeon loot we can sell so we can buy more property. We'll keep an eye out for Axe's return, and look into the **Flame** cult. We're also going to research and experiment on the **crystal flower** and try to grow it.

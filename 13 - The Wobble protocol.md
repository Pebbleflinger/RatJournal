"If it's in the ocean, it's a fish." - Chosen

We find a fish (?) **fountain**. Looks more like a dolphin. A fountain with an ornamental statue, at least Krozzot doesn't think it's religious. Wobble drinks the water, which is water-flavoured. The fountain is broken and some water is spilling out. The room is in disrepair, similar to the rest of the dungeon. Krozzot considers fighting the statue. I take a look at the **craftsmanship**; it's well-made but it doesn't look like any parts can move as part of a **mechanism**.

Cormul loses sight of Tony for a minute and panics. It's hard being a single parent… He returns to the treasure room to thoroughly search the piles of cursed gold. He resists the curse, digs out a pair of cheap **goggles**, is disappointed. Cormul gets cursed with greed, I command Smula to dropkick him for emotional support, he snaps out of it. Sevaris is making snow angels in the gold, so I give him the same treatment.

Cormul finds a bracelet, and a couple of larger gold coins that stand out from the rest. They're **ancient gold coins**, we assume these won't disappear when we leave. Krozzot stayed behind at the desk and is searching it thoroughly. Under the desk, he spots ~~a phone number~~ the words "**golden water**" engraved into the wood. And here are the piss jokes again.

Cormul and me find a room half-full of **corpses**. Lovely… We sneak into a crack, end up in a desolate area of cracked stone and darkness. Nothing here, so we return to "the shitter", the pool of water that gets emptied and refilled by the pull of a **lever**. "What if the shitter is actually the **pisser**," Cormul theorises. They are obssessing over the golden water and want to piss everywhere. Sevaris is zooming around the castle and opening doors.

Turns out the plan is to beat up Cormul until he pisses himself, he wants to charge for it. Instead of resorting to violence, Cormul volunteers to **drop a coin** into the water of the fish fountain. As he does, the water turns **golden**!

"Could it be the legendary… piss?" Cormul

"Can we spin the fish now?" Krozzot

"Wobble drinks the golden water, does it taste like piss?" Cormul (He can't tell but Wobble is fine)

"You can taste through Wobble too" Krozzot

"The Midas touch" Sevaris

We giggle at how Mr Chosen says "gold income" and discuss the exact mechanics of Midas.

Krozzot insist on **spinning the fish**. Cormul claims piss is the best lubricant. I say the fish is not meant to be spun. Krozzot tries to spin the fish. The fish does not budge. Our orc boy insists the fish will be spinnable. I give up.

We drop some coins into "the shitter". The water doesn't change. "It was a sinker, not a floater," Sevaris mumbles. Well, we go to the round pool and **throw in the coins**. "Another sinker," the fairy comments.

"Can Mr Wobble outsource the water he drank?" - "No he doesn't piss. Things that are in Wobble remain in Wobble." Also known as the **Wobble protocol**.

We decide to splash everything with golden water, "marking our territory," Sevaris says. Cormul puts the golden water in the ~~dolphinussy~~ blow hole but nothing happens except the DM giggling half his arse off. We pour golden water on the corpses, on the cursed gold, on the cracked throne, and on the statues.

When Krozzot pours water on the desk, it **soaks** into the wood like a sponge and drips onto the floor. In front of "golden water" now glows the word "**drink**". I am being **volunteered** to drink the golden water because nobody can speak to Wobble. Sevaris somehow slips through cracks in the walls that shouldn't be here, than the hand of God slaps him back into the cage with us. Hmmmmm.

"Chosen, just like piss, you can't hold us forever. You have to let us go at some point."

Sevaris offers a prayer and drinks the water. It tastes like water and he doesn't feel any different. He goes to the treasure room… and doesn't see any **gold**! We all drink the water, including Tony somehow. As he finishes drinking (somehow), the walls begin to wobble as the dungeon is **closing**!

We leave, and the **ring of coins** that marked the entrance of the dungeon flies to Tony and attach themselves to him like a necklace. He tries to take it off to show Cormul, but the coins just slip back around his neck. Cormul is very proud of his boy's first bling. Krozzot performs surgery on himself to heal up, it goes surprisingly well. We return to the boat and hop on board, and Krozzot charts a course south as we travel to the southern **crater**.

Ruka rolls a crit, again. Chosen is confused about how he eats up the probabilities like this. We sail, fish, and I **scout** the way to the southern crater without any problems! Krozzot advises me to drink golden water every day. He says **Cormul can provide**. Turns out… Cormul doesn't source his golden water locally! What a scandal. A scam-dal. Heheh.

Krozzot and me descend into the crater with style. Cormul descends normally, like a normal person. Sevaris just floats down. We discuss potatoes. At length. At the centre of the crater, we see a groove as if a rod was here, but is now gone (and a chunk of rock with it). Cormul tells me to track the crystal rod by **scent**. Sevaris smashes rocks to produce more crystals so I can catch the scent. I… roll to sniff? Natural 1. Well here we go again. Looks like I caught a cold in the dungeon and I can't even smell cheese!

We suggest walking to the crater south of the **Ice Fields** to check if there is any crystal to be had there. We can't sail very far, as the water is frozen, but Krozzot insists to park the ship as close as possible. I somehow find the way to the crater on the first try. Krozzot once more descends in style. The rest of us descend normally, and at the bottom of the crater we are met with the same scene as the previous one; someone had beaten us to the shiny rock. Everyone is mad for some reason. It's just a rock? Cormul tells me to try **Operation Sniff** again so I take out a small handkerchief, give it a good shake, and make trumpet noises into it until my nose unclogs. I just smell **animals**, no rock.

Welp. I try to find the way to the city of **Kratin** and… it's a natural 1. We make it a little way east of the crater and… I'm lost. I look around, take out the map, ah I was holding it **upside down**, that explains a lot… We finally make our way to Kratin. The guards at the gate are cat people… how scary. I would sit on Wobble but that's where Tony sits and we don't think we can build a higher tower by adding a rat.

Sevaris cries "Free rat, come and get your rat!" I try to shush him but a cat-man comes over, Cormul tells him he has to pay, he leaves disappointed. I hug Smula for comfort, we were so close to death… Sevaris wants to **sell rats** for profit. Cormul suggests I have children, which he could take off my hands (and then sell). I tell him to find me a dashing **rat gentleman** first.

The river in Kratin flows in a circle like a serpent biting its own tail. This bothers the others for some reason. We decide to get a **rat flag** for our ship, and Sevaris and Cormul still want to sell naturally produced, free-range rats. Then they discuss finding me a **rat gentleman** who would always know where I am, then hire a nanny to keep track of our children…

I'm dead inside. That's it, my little notebook is turning into a book of grudges. I must go north and study with the **dwarves**.

We go find the markets to sell the bullshit we **looted**. We go into an adventuring shop, and the shopkeep is a big bear man. I hope he isn't hungry, but on the off-chance, I suggest Sevaris as a snack. He claims fairies taste bad, it's like eating a **moth**, you just get a lot of powder. Cormul wonders if moths taste good. I suggest he feeds Sevaris to Wobble to find out. Eating business partners is bad, they claim. But the hypothetical children of your business partners are fair game?? I go sulk in the corner, occasionally nibbling on **cheese** to soothe my poor nerves.

We sell the **Smoking Sword**, and learn there is a network of underwater caves below the city. Which leads us to sell the **Diving Suit** as well. We sell the **Sun Goggles** and the **Pendant of the Occult**. Sevaris uses some conman-tier bargaining, trying to pull the wool over the bear man's eyes. It's unbearable… We also sell our **Gold and garnet ring**, and a **Scroll of Mystic Armor**. Cormul also sells an **Aetheric Irritant**, and Sevaris sets to marketing the **Psychic Warding Bracelet** (against Jedi mind tricks). Mr Bear is running out of funds.

Cormul uses his secret weapon, French, to sell **dragon eggs** (Still fresh! Taste quite good, or so I'm told. And who has never dreamt of a dragon pet?) and **dragon scales**. Mr Bear buys them. Then at last, Cormul pulls out the **crystal rod**. The shopkeep seems shocked, and says he can't buy the rod, but the city leadership would want to get their hands on it. It's too valuable for shops to buy… He directs us to the building **on top of the hill**.

We split the earnings, each of us 4 gets **114 gold** pieces. Krozzot is tired and shuffles off to the closest inn, so we decide to join him. In the morning we'll look for nearby dungeons, or maybe go visit the faraway crater on the off-chance of a crystal rod.

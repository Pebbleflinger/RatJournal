Cormul finds an old man selling a similarly old **sailboat** for 20 gold. ~~Not a Karve from Valheim~~. We all pitch in so Cormul can't swindle us on passage fees. Sevaris asks where we can take the boat for repairs, just in case. The old man says, he **repairs** boats. We could bring it to him. Sevaris thanks him, and we discuss tar. Cormul sits down and works out a name for the boat. The difficult task, that.

Krozzot does an unpaid internship with a **fisherman**, hauling nets in exchange for learning how to steer a boat. Our orc boy also asks about the lake waters. The man says, stay away from the **watchtowers**, the weather nearby is chaotic. There are stories of boats sinking near them. Good waters for fishing. Krozzot spends 7 silver on **supplies** for feeeeesh (nets, hooks, bait, gutting knives…)

I search for other **Ysoki** and find a warren in the cliffs next to town, with an entrance in a demolished building. I bring **cheese** as an offering. It is only polite. I am thanked for it, and it is shared among the community. I speak with the warren **Elder**. Nobody has seen or heard of my family… However, some of their children have gone **missing**. I tell them about the **piper**, warn them to keep an ear out. The watch around the warren has been strengthened. They will listen for rumours of a piper as they look for their lost children, and I promise to be in touch again if I learn anything.

In the evening, we return to the inn. One last time, discuss where to go! We confirm, "**feral** **animals**" far to the south and the west. They don't wear armour. Long distance on water, but Krozzot knows how to pilot a boat now. You say pilot? Cormul says, you say **sail**. Krozzot says, but we bought the boat, we're not selling it. There is a long silence in which Smula happily munches. We discuss what **route** to take. Stay within sight of the coast, not too close in case of rocks. Stay far from the west watchtower. We don't know why it's dangerous, Sevaris finds it suspicious. For now, we sail and then we fight. Then monies, and cheese.

There is not a lot of wind. Slow sailing… especially as we pass close to the watchtower. We sail the whole day, arrive in the **evening**. We are not camping in the jungle with next to no supplies, nuh-uh. We sleep on the boat. Krozzot has first watch, Sevaris second, I take third, Cormul wants last. We decide to not light as much as a lantern. Stealth. Sevaris casts **Detect Magic**, and finds nothing. No magic shark right below us, phew.

Sevaris hears **splashing** on his watch, something big circling the boat. He decides to keep real quiet, hoping the big fish gives up. After a while, it does give up. Sevaris tells me about it when he wakes me, but I hear nothing. Cormul's watch is uneventful. Day dawns, and we have breakfast, then venture into the jungle. I go first on the marching order, **scouting**.

We travel at **half speed** and encounter no dangers. Rat eyes are good eyes! A door standing on its own between trees. Must be the dungeon. We spent most of the day crawling through the jungle so it's **evening** by the time we get to the dungeon. We look for a good campsite outside the dungeon. I find a snuggly spot between some trees, we could get cozy and hidden in here. We bully Cormul into camping outside instead of bumbling unprepared into the dungeon. We set up the same watches as last night. On my watch I hear something large walk around the camp… I quietly wake the others, so if it comes to a fight, we are all alert. Sevaris mumbles in his sleep in languages I don't understand.

We ready ourselves. **Wobble** is growing. The creature outside stops moving, we hear it breathe. It stomps, the ground shakes. Then it leaves. Wobble scared him away, for sure. Cormul, Krozzot, and Sevaris go back to sleep. Cormul and Wobble take the last watch. They hear a faraway roar, but no immediate threat. It's a grumpy morning. I mutter about the damp, wring out my tail. Muggy jungle, and insects. Wobble shakes the morning dew off his leaves, showering me with more water.

We walk into the dungeon, the door opening without a creak. From outside, it seems dark but as we walk in, we see clearly. Spiral stone stairs lead into torchlit darkness. It's like a crumbling temple. We hear enemies slithering in the dark, and hatch a plan. Sevaris casts **Light** to flashbang them, and I ready up my bow so the moment the light flares up, I loose my arrow.

To our left, a straight bridge leads to a wall of rubble left by a cave-in. Cormul starts combat with a **Frostbite** on one of the **Giant Vipers**. The snake slithers along the cave wall, close to us. I use my **Hunt Prey** and scowl at it, then shoot. It hits home, and I back away a bit. Sevaris hits it with a critical Ray of Frost, half of the snake is now popsicle. My arrow still sticks out of it, it's the popsicle stick, how delicious. Something large moves in the darkness and appears on top of the rubble. Crickey mate, that's a big boy. The **Crocodile** jumps down the pile of rubble and crashes onto the bridge. It faceplants onto the bridge so hard that it lands prone, but gets up. It does flatten the snake-cicle a little bit.

Krozzot's **Devise Stratagem** comes up… natural 20! ~~Critmeister Ruka strikes again~~. On **Recall** **Knowledge**, Krozzot gets another nat 20!! Mr DM mutters about loaded dice. Ruka casually looks at the stat block, then chucks Chakri at the big scaly for spicy damage. The second attack is a natural 1. Perfectly balanced. One hero point later, it's still a miss but not critical. The Crocodile is already hurt so badly, I might be able to finish it off with an arrow. Krozzot whispers to me "it has 5 HP" and **Shares Stratagem** with me.

Cormul realises that calling the snake fat is not going to help, on account of it not speaking ~~Common~~ Taldane. He still goes for **Demoralize**, rolls a critical on **Intimidation**. He shows the snake and empty plate and growls "It's time for fifth breakfast…" The snake shudders, **frightened**. One radish with Guidance begins to leaf-slap the snake, then the crocodile. Both die. I shoot at the last snek that was holding onto the wall. My arrow pierces it, and it drops into the water below.

On Krozzot's suggestion, I draw my dagger and **skin** the croc. The orc tries to skin the small snake, but does a poor job of it. I manage mine decently, and shove a good amount of crocodile skin into my pack. ~~purse material~~ We decide to go south first because Cormul hates the idea of climbing over the rubble. We find a toppled statue and a wide **bowl** with water in it. An item of religious significance? Cormul says it's a pet water bowl, and lets Wobble schlorp from it. Sevaris tries Detect Magic, ignoring the magical radish next to him, and detects faint magic nearby. The toppled statue is that of a **kneeling dwarf**, in a praying stance. I figure out the water is **holy water**.

Mr Chosen drops his snus so we have a slight delay while Mr Novator asks about holy water in relation to fighting undead. Please stand by.

Sevaris has empty vials, so he wrestles with Wobble for some water, and manages to fill 2 vials of radish-scented holy water. We continue west among ruins and broken stairs. ~~Ruka turns himself black~~. On top of a small pyramid, surrounded by braziers, a big bear is sleeping. We agree on another surprise attack, so choose the bear as my **Prey**, and nock an arrow. The first one hit hard, but the second arrow misses. I step back and clamber onto the ruins for the extra height.

A **Bat** swoops down and attacks Cormul. Flying rats! Sevaris asks if we are related. The bats are NOT my long-lost cousins! Please fight them! Sevaris casts **Needle Darts**, but misses. Krozzot chucks Chakri at the bat, incredibly does not crit. Wobble is fighting close-combat with three bats. He tears one to bits.

I use my last **Hero Point** to reroll my first shot on the bear (it was a natural 1), and deal max damage! My second arrow is aimed at a bat, and misses. Then I **command** Smula to bite the bat, and it's a critical miss (also natural 1). Yes that is two nat 1s in one turn. What even is my luck. Sevaris casts **Purifying Icicle** on the bear, killing it. This prompts some grumbling from the DM, followed by bear puns. Unbearable…

Krozzot slices at one of the remaining bats, with limited success. The bat attacks, with even further limited success. The other bat attacks, with somehow even less success in the form of 3 critical misses in one single turn. I feel a lot better about my luck. I shoot the remaining bat, Smula bites it real good, and Sevaris finishes it off with a **Ray of Frost** ~~and a Hero Point~~.

We start to look around while I **skin** the bear. My paws are all shaky from the excitement of the fight, so I damage it a bit, but I might still be able to sell it. Cormul heads to the pyramid the bear was sleeping on, and picks up some treasure, and a **hand cannon** (?) from a corpse. We find another bowl, but it's empty. A skeleton holds a single coin. To the south, partially lit passages lead to a pit in the floor. Cormul loots two other corpses, two tangled skeletons ~~they gay~~ but finds nothing.

We return to the pile of **rubble** north-east of the entrance, looting two more coins off skeletons on the way.

"Feathers are lighter than radish." "Have you been drinking?"

Krozzot climbs the rubble, and drops a **rope** down for us all to follow, except Sevaris who casually flutters over. There is another pyramid lit by braziers here, and a bowl of holy water. We go south, to two small empty rooms and one chasm to the west. About **30 feet** straight down. We plan on crossing the chasm to explore the other side. On next week's episode, read with bated breath as our heroes devise a dodgy plan to cross the chasm!

Now accompanied by **Tony** the undead goblin, we walk southish towards the dungeon labelled **Elementals**. Or so I thought. We went more like east and the party follows me to the foot of the **Black Mountains**… my luck strikes again. We reach the area marked on the map and start looking for the dungeon. No luck… wait! This bush is oddly lonely… I go poke it with a stick and it scuttles away? That's not how bushes work!

"Sevaris! Is this some kind of magic shullbit again?"

"I don't know but I can burn it!"

"Without burning it, what do your wizard eyes see?"

The branches on the bush forms legs when it runs away. Sevaris immediately casts **Produce** **Flame** to trap it inside a ring of fire. None of us speak bush though… Cormul tells Wobble to interrogate the bush. Wobble could speak all this time?! He asks "are you food or friend?". The bush responds "**friend**", and Wobble's leaves wilt in disappointment. Sevaris understood the entire exchange. Naturally the fairy can speak bush.

Sevaris asks the bush to tell us where the dungeon is. The bush says it will show us, if we come closer. The wizard readies a spell, very suspicious. Cormul is not a scaredy-rat and as Sevaris drops part of the blazing circle, the halfling approaches with soothing words. The bush grabs him and **drags** him into itself. Maybe the bush taught Cormul the secrets of bushkind? Sevaris cries, "The bush ate my fellow bootless companion!" Krozzot sends **Tony** to the bush, and he also disappears inside it.

"Nori, you are the **scout**," Krozzot tells me. Ah, that's how it is then. Inside the bush are… stone walls, inside of which are Cormul and Tony! Wobble joins us, followed by Sevaris and finally Krozzot. Sevaris drops the fire spell, at Krozzot's urging.

We enter into a stone room, where a pile of crates is burning by a pillar. A stone at the end of the room emits a **purple glow**. Sevaris makes a beeline for more fire in the room to the right. He seems at home here somehow.

Technical difficulties, please stand by.

We go north through a winding **tunnel** that seems dug, not built like the rest. A small room off to the east. Further north, the ground falls away in **holes**, looks very foggy in there. Krozzot chucks in a rock, doesn't hear it fall. I hear screaming to the west and rejoin with my other companions. Of course we immediately split the party upon entering the dungeon…

Another room with pillars, where part of the floor seems frozen over. A **statue** stands at the far end. More purple stones bathe the area in a purple glow. Further to the west, a larder connected to a room with a big dinner table! I look for cheese, but seems Wobble was faster… beyond the dinner table is another room with a desk sitting on a large rug. Sevaris searches the desk but finds nothing. A **chest** stands in a corner, which Krozzot searches (the chest not the corner, though the former is in the latter technically). A trap! Dark smoke grabs at Krozzot, he dodges and the smoke dissipates. Inside the chest are golden **shoulder pads** and a **robe** with mirror-like fabric.

I take a look at the robe but… no idea what it can do. Sevaris flies in and takes a look. I look at the shoulder pads, but just scratch my head. Meanwhile Sevaris and Cormul are looting **weapons and armour**: 2 mauls, 2 shields, 1 sword, 1 chainmail, 2 breastplates. The next room over has 8 swords and 8 sets of chainmail. We scoop up as much as we can but it's too heavy, so we lug it outside, anticipating the dungeon closing. Krozzot finally identifies the **Mirror Robe**. Cormul suggests Wobble carries the loot but Krozzot fears the radish will only eat it.

I write down a Cormul quote in my **notebook**: Magic is indistinguishable from high-level farming. It's a lot of sweat and blood and tears and abuse of the lower class; that's what magic is.

I do neither farming nor magic. Words of wisdom indeed.

Wobble carries the loot, somehow without eating it. We find some purple glowing crystals and pry some out. The statue in the frozen room, Krozzot says, is a depiction of **Iomedae**… she seems out of place here. The fire in the first room has grown in intensity! Sevaaaaaris?? He claims he has done nothing. Doubt.

We return to the room full of mist and holes, looking for the bottomless pit elementals. Smells like wet stone in here… Sevaris casts **Gale Blast** to clear out the mist. We hear a hawk's cry echo out! It sounds annoyed when Sevaris casts the spell again. He casts it a third time and… we roll initiative as 4 angry birds fly out of the pit!

Sevaris casts **Blazing Bolt**, frying 2 of the birds but not lethally. Krozzot stares at the birds to figure out how sick their dodges are, then he attacks with the ~~boomerang~~ **Returning Chakram**. Cormul casts **Guidance**, then throws Wobble at the enemy.

A bird does a drive-by on Smula and it's a crit, she falls unconscious… Then Wobble gets crit, and Krozzot gets crit. What?! OUR BOY TONY grabs a **healing potion** from Sevaris' backpack and pours it on Smula, saving her life. My paws are free to attack, so I shoot one of the birds, miraculously hit, roll like ass on damage. Oh well at least it's not another critical miss.

Sevaris casts **Scorching Blast**, but misses. Krozzot murders one of the birds, then rolls a natural 1. Cormul uses Demoralize on one bird, but it doesn't speak Taldane or Halfling… he rerolls with a Hero Point and hurts the bird's feelings, then unleashes Wobble on them. Wobble has Reach and rolls a crit, and that's max damage. The radish does three times the damage I do…

Smula gets attacked again! Both Krozzot and Cormul are getting beaten up… I shoot a bird, but forget to apply **Hunt Prey**, and do absolute trash damage. Sevaris chucks a **Telekinetic Projectile** and deletes the bird from existence. Krozzot slices up the third bird, it's ready for KFC. The last one is readying a high-speed **Circling Attack**… oh no. Cormul casts **Protect Companion** and sends in the Wobble, who misses both his attacks. Wobble gets slapped, but Cormul takes the damage for him. Cormul faints, and Wobble dissipates.

I hunt the last bird and shoot it, but fail to kill it. I do need to get some more runes into that bow… Sevaris casts an **Electric Arc** on the bird, but it dodges. Krozzot orders Tony to feed Cormul a healing potion, then crits the bird and kills it! That was kind of close… Cormul wakes up and immediately starts growing another radish.

Krozzot treats his wounds, and Cormul's, then Smula's. I have her hop into my pocket and rest here, as the mist in the room becomes so thick we could collect it in our paws… Sevaris chucks a shining rock into the pit, but as far as we can tell it is indeed **bottomless**. "Look Nori it's the magical pit of class change to Barbarian," Quain says.

We retrace our steps to the small room to the east, where the fire has spread. Sevaris decides to literally fight fire with fire and casts **Produce Flame**. The fire says something in a language none of us understands, then a fire elemental steps out, hands some **Ember Dust** to Sevaris, refuses to elaborate, leaves. We go south to two other rooms with fires. Sevaris puts **Alchemist's Fire** down on the floor, and fire elementals reach for it, which of course detonates it. The elementals seem happy and give 10 arrows made of fire! Sevaris casts **Message** to say "Thanks!" but gets no reaction.

Sevaris gives me the arrows and mutters "You owe me a rat and 10 arrows. My potion saved your rat." She has a name you know! We receive 10 more fire arrows, and everything starts to wobble! The dungeon is **closing**! We run out, exiting from the bush and getting slapped in the face by its branches. The bush speaks, them crumples in on itself and disappears. Sevaris translates, "That's it for me then." Such secrets of bushkind…

It's sunset so we decide to set up camp. On the second watch, Sevaris casts **Create Water**, heats it, and puts my hand in it to "wake me". I shake the water at him, then go take my watch. Nothing bad happens during the night, and we start on our way back to **Port Leon**.

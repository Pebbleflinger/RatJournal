What are Krozzot's happy thoughts? Cormul would rather not know. Orc man acquires a **Symbol of Conflict** which allows him to cast **Bless**. I buy a pair of **Tracker's Goggles** and Krozzot jokes these are like grandma's glasses so I can find the mountains. Very funny, big boots. We discuss our mysterious crystal rod and whether to sell it to the city rulers, but decide not to because government = taxes and that is bad. Cormul buys a big piece of tarp, which is canvas and unrelated to fish, to wrap around the crystal rod and hide it. It's not very effective, and Krozzot is going on about carps.

Cormul decides to buy a legally distinct bag of holding, also known as a **Spacious Pouch**. We then go look for trouble, which is dungeons (for non-taxable income) and information about the big crystal we definitely don't have.

Cormul is not having a good time gathering information; he is very obviously foreign and gets ignored a lot. I assume Wobble is not helping much. Krozzot is having no more luck, people seem to look down on him with disgust. I try to gather **information about dungeons** but make no headway. Sevaris comes up with the brilliant idea to shoot through town with fire in his hands yelling "The end is coming, only a dungeon is safe!" Except he shouts in Demonic and Diabolic…

Predictably, he soon gets **arrested** and the three of us don't know him anymore. Sevaris flees and flies out of town. We conspicuously walk out of town saying loudly we will get that fairy if we bump into him, ha ha.

We find Sevaris and I start scouting the way west to the crater by the **Underwater** dungeon. We make good time and stop for the night, and Krozzot and me go hunting. Krozzot that's not an altar that's a rock. We manage to shoot two **deers** and Krozzot carries them because a deer is far too heavy for a little ratfolk girl. We skin them perfectly, though Krozzot's hand keeps firing up for some reason. Something about his lightning magic course. We light a fire and get to cooking, by we I mean I. It turns out well-grilled and delicious!

Our DM gets distracted by racism of cabbage and turnips, then we take turns for the night watch. During my watch, I hear **heavy footsteps** coming towards the camp. I light a torch and call "Who goes there?", hopefully loudly enough to wake my companions. It's a large man with grey skin and a hat (like a fedora but not gay). He says he is just travelling through and asks to rest at our fire. He seems relaxed despite being massive ("built like a brick shithouse" were the DM's exact words). I invite him to sit by the fire and he warms himself during my watch. I wake Cormul when it's his turn and tell him to BE NICE to the big man.

Cormul starts chatting with the giant, asks for nearby **dungeons**. He learns the giant is going to visit a friend further west. Cormul flexes his radish to the stranger, asks about the general area. They discuss the craters and Cormul lies, claiming we've never gone down into one. The giant has, and found a **blue crystal rod** which he still has at home, back in Kratin. I find myself having nightmares, Cormul's greed seeping into my dreams…

Cormul claims being mentally linked to Wobble makes him half-radish. The giant asks if that is the reason he is so short. No, the Halfling says, he was short before becoming half-radish. Cormul asks about where the giant lives, as he will not be **back home** in a while on account of visiting his friend (and the crystal is back in his house unsupervised). Then he brings up bandits, for no reason at all. After which the giant leaves, gifting us a **bottle** as thanks for sharing our fire.

In the morning I accuse Cormul to try to make money off of the friendly giant. He denies, and says he has found another crystal, at this address in Kratin. We are not robbing this man!! Besides Sevaris cannot return to Kratin without getting his glittering ass arrested. I suggest throwing a sheet over him to **disguise** him as a ghost. Krozzot grumbles that he was promised a **big carp**. We try once more to explain that we never mentioned a carp and he just heard "tarp" wrong but he will not have it.

Cormul tries to explain why it is morally correct for him to steal. Then Krozzot rolls a **Religion** check to challenge Cormul's belief system, natural 1, and he is expert… We argue about stealing the rod, Krozzot and me desperately try to dissuade the others from it. Cormul caves, but Sevaris doubles down. Cormul says we should **bribe the police**. Sevaris grumbles the police hates everyone, not just him. To my great relief we finally decide to get moving to the crater, but Cormul refuses to drop the matter.

We take another look at our own **Big Fucking Crystal**. It's as puzzling as ever… Krozzot thinks a crystal like this could be used as a catalyst in a large-scale magic **ritual** of some sort. He plans to look further into that later on. I start **scouting** the way north-west, and Cormul is praying I get us lost and we arrive back in the city. I show him how it's done and we arrive at the crater after a good walk. Krozzot styles down as before, skating on a flat rock like a certain elf on a shield in a certain fortress by the name of Helm's Deep.

There is a crystal! Well, only the very base of it is still stuck in the ground, the rest of the rod has been snapped off and carried away. Smula and me refuse to dig up the rock with our claws, are you joking, I just got my claws done. Cormul conveniently remembered to buy a **shovel** and Krozzot gets to digging. It takes an hour of fighting but he extracts a crystal the length of his forearm. We obtain a **Small Fucking Crystal**!

We walk north-east for four hours, getting close to the **Underwater** dungeon. Krozzot catches a rabbit, I'm not too excited about eating a rodent so I try to shoot up a bird. However instead of hunting birds, I get hunted by birds as I piss off a whole murder of **crows** who proceeds to chase me around. Sevaris regrets not buying the item that lets him speak to crows, so he could cheer them on. As I pick feathers off my clothes after shaking them off, Cormul advises me to **extort** any nightly travellers.

We spend a quiet night, and in the morning I guide us straight to the location marked on our map. These **goggles** are really something else! As I am leading the way, I find myself suddenly at the entrance of a flooded cave, water plants growing under the surface. My companions soon join me into the dungeon.

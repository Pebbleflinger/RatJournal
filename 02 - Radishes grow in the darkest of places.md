Three boys, one radish, and one rat descend to the third level of the mine.

Immediately we feel suffocating pressure. Reluctantly, we start to explore. We find our man, then we get out, and we eat cheese. "And potatoes," Krozzot chimes in. Sevaris flies ahead as we enter a wide room. He spots flickering lights ahead. Cormul sends Wobble (who is still shining) to fetch the glittering objects. The radish crashes into some barrels, then into a small creature. It's a Shadow Wisp! There are three of them, tiny little smoke-sprites, and they attack us.

Cormul, with perfect initiative, tries to intimidate a wisp. It does not work out, so he commands Wobble to eat the wisp. Wobble obeys and takes a nibble out of the thing. Krozzot thinks long and hard on what the wisps are, has very little idea, so he chucks a chakram at one. Cormul gets massacred by two wisps and falls unconscious, which takes Wobble out of the fight as well. He vanishes, and the light with him. The last wisp whacks Krozzot with a vengeance. Sevaris casts Rejuvenating Flames, burning enemies and healing allies.

I drop my bow to light a torch, and let Smula out from my pocket. I command her to attack the wisps, which she attempts, but the wisp dodges. I stand here with my torch like a mined potato. Cormul casts an Electric Arc, inflicting light damage, then casts Guidance on Krozzot. Our orc boy comes up with a stratagem, figures out what the wisps are, and whacks the living daylight out of one, sending it all the way into next month. We're never seeing that one again. He slices another one for good measure.

Krozzot gets slapped for his efforts, twice. He's a grave orc so it doesn't hurt him that much, phew. Sevaris casts Force Barrage, trying to kill one wisp, but no luck. I drop my torch, pick up my bow, and aim above Cormul and Sevaris. Confident, I loose my arrow… only to critically miss. I yell at Smula to finish the job, but the wisp has some sick dodges. What is wrong with my dice.

Cormul is a productive member of society, from his vantage position which is the floor, he zaps one wisp to death, and casts Guidance on the rat. The big rat, that is me. I do need it. Krozzot slices at the last wisp with his sword, and promptly murders it.

Sevaris casts Light on himself, so he is extra glittery. Cormul finally deigns to get up from the floor, walks up to a crack in the stone, plants a seed and waters it. A fully grown Wobble springs to life! Cormul makes him shine bright. The boys are licking their wounds, figuratively speaking, so I pick up my torch and go check the room for signs of passage. It's all dusty so I assume nobody passed through here in a while. The boys check for loot, find only rotten food that is given to Wobble (it's fertiliser, right?).

This room is split by a chasm we can't see the bottom of. Cormul picks up a piece of wood, casts Light on it, and drops it into the hole. It drops about 60 feet (20 metres in non-retard) and splashes into water. Cormul calls into the chasm, and only gets an echo back.

We continue along the minecart tracks, and find an intersection. We go left, down some rough stairs, and find a ledge full of bones… Krozzot stares at them, but has no idea what creature they came from. Wobble crunches on some of the bones. We continue into a wide cavern, which narrows into a passage at one end. We come to a shallow pool about 10 feet below us, and Sevaris drops Light on himself and quietly flies over the water, hugging the walls.

On the other side is ~~mushrooms~~ a man in armour holding a flaming sword and channelling a spell. We decide to nope out before he notices us. We are pretty beaten up. Sevaris has no idea what spell the armoured guy is casting.

Mr Quain is ruining our immersion.

We back out to investigate the other direction. To aid in this, Sevaris makes himself shine again. There are webs, the tunnel ends in a cave-in, but a path branches off to the right. We go. Crossroads. Right, a wide shallow pit and many skittering rats. Cormul suggests I speak to them. I am offended. I speak to rat people, not to non-people rats. Smula is an exception, she is my friend.

Middle, a passage leads to a giant spider nest! The spider, it is dead. Head caved in. Phew. Wobble tries the spider, kinda jerky but all right, he says. This cavern is also a dead end, rocks at the far end. Krozzot picks up something from the dead spider. Poison? I tear off a leg from the big spider, as an offering for the dungeon rats. The rats swarm to the spider leg, clearing off the rest of the floor. We see bones that look like people bones. Hmm.

Cormul suggests we chop up the spider, and make a trail of spider-bits to lead the rats to the bad guy so the rats eat him up, and we get the sword. Meh. We return to the crossing, and take the left path. We walk through a tunnel and… there is a click at my feet! The mine inside the mine explodes! Me and Smula throw ourselves to the side, falling over Krozzot. Light burns. Now we are looking for traps…

We come to a small room, with three makeshift straw beds and… two other mines hidden in the floor. Stairs at the far end of the room go up, so we go up. Three ledges, two dead goblins. They've been dead a long time. Slashing wounds, no burns. Cormul loots the bodies, finds a little gold. A third ledge to the right, wood stairs, another dead goblin. On the left is a small ledge, and a dead adventurer in leather armour. He died recently. Very recently. If we'd hurried, maybe we would have found him alive. So anyway, Krozzot steals the dead man's sword.

At the far end of this cavern, a twisting tunnel leads to stairs. We assume this leads to the guy with the flaming sword… I tiptoe towards him, very scared indeed. One last room we hadn't explored, it's full of loot! 25 gold on a table, a lantern that is unlit. A chest containing 4 mines like the one that exploded in my face, not active. Krozzot swipes some gold, Cormul grabs the mines. Sevaris grabs 10 gold, and Cormul takes the remaining 8 gold while I go for a pee in a corner because "Nori isn't here and the money might go stale, because of inflation".

Ah-hah. I'll just pester him to buy me cheese.

Krozzot fixes up my wounds, feels a lot better. We argue about fighting the armoured man. Cormul tries to convince Krozzot to go fight the guy by saying there might be potatoes in that room. Maybe a little mining shaft in the corner with potatoes. We decide to wait a bit to treat the rest of our wounds. Krozzot is a doctor with diploma from Google university and heals himself to full on a crit. Cormul heals most of the way.

We make for the room where the armoured guy was, discussing our approach. Sevaris casts Light on me, so I leave my torch in a corner. Cormul places a mine square in the middle of the stairs, to bait the man onto it if we have to flee. Clever, as long as you remember where you place your traps when you place traps. Speaking from experience. Cormul boosts Wobble with Runic Body, and we run in.

The guy spots us and says "I see there are more rats here." That's ratcist! I'm offended! Sevaris leads the charge by the power of a 20 in initiative and casts Purifying Icicle. Krozzot thinks hard about the armoured man who is called an Abberton Ruffian, but he is worried to move close and chucks the chakram from far away and misses. He bravely gets closer but still misses.

The Ruffian's sword of flame disappears; he puts his hand to his helmet and whistles. Eggs crack, hands crawl out, and the Ruffian resumes channelling his spell. ~~Add phase boys!~~ A hand slaps Krozzot. Cormul casts Guidance on Wobble who barrels towards the bad guy and grapples him with a critical success! Wobble tries to take a bite out of him, but the armour is too crunchy.

I stare at the Ruffian, he is my prey now. I aim, shoot… and miss. Twice. What in the world, the second roll was a 19! Sevaris flies up the stairs and casts Electric Arc. Finally it's a hit, and it grills one of the hands too. Some hand puns and a few points of psychic damage to our DM later, Krozzot slices a hand out of existence. Clean cut, have to hand it to him. ~~Critmaster Ruka~~

A giant spider strolls in. More food for the rats! My brethren cry out in hunger. It webs Krozzot. The Ruffian continues casting his spell, big concern. Cormul tries to Demoralise him, is ruthlessly ignored. Wobble continues chewing on the armour, to no avail. I shoot and miss, command Smula to run up to him and flank him. Another Electric Arc from Sevaris chips at the Ruffian.

Further hand puns, in Czech this time, but the crawling hands don't manage to hit Wobble, he is so wobbly it's getting out of hand. "ruka" is "hand" in Czech, and Krozzot is played by Ruka. So we have many ruka killed by THE Ruka. There can be only one!

With great conviction, the giant spider webs Cormul. He casts Boost Eidolon, whispering sweet promises of food to Wobble, who finally gets a bite in. One bite. Out of three. I shoot twice and miss both, just can't get an arrow into that armour. Smula is more successful, she lands a wicked bite for a creature her size. Sevaris zaps the boss and the spiders, delicious smell of grilled arachnid?

Ruka crits, as usual. Then, he does it again and chucks a spicy chakri at the boss, killing him. His dying words: "You will never understand…" and his body turns to ash. The spider webs me, bleh. Cormul speaks arcane words of "va-kyu-uuuum clearners" and frightens the spider. Wobble tries to chew on the spider, but chitin is armour too.

I free myself from the web. I have never been bound in my life! Dash up the stairs, aim at the spider, roll a 3. Hero point to reroll, I finally hit it! I deal! 1 point of damage! My curse lives on in the rat! I AM THE PEBBLEFLINGER!

Anyways Sevaris grills the spider to death and combat ends. Cormul grabs the armour from the Ruffian's pile of ash body; +1 Bastion Plate. Sevaris grabs a Lesser Aetheric Irritant off the Ruffian. I nibble on the grilled spider. A bit chewy, tastes kind of like chicken. Wobble hurries to help me in my noble task. We have a nice post-battle snack. In the tents, we find two healing potions. Krozzot finds boots that help the wearer jump better without having to run first. We pick up arrows and chakrams, and haul ass back out of here.

We level up to 2! And return to Port Leon.

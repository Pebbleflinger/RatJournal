We descend to the basement. Cormul casts **Summoner's Precaution**. When did he learn that?! We send Wobble in first. Clay jars in the first room we find. Cormul opens one, they stink! A cracked altar, scored with cuts… Krozzot is happy, reminds him of home. Sevaris considers grabbing one of the foul jars to complain about it in a store… Cormul and me argue about the friendly dwarf again, ending in me thinking hard and not finding an easy answer. We start roaming through narrow corridors. Sevaris finds a thing. In a coffin, a corpse is lying on a bed of **silver coins**. Cormul is GREATLY interested. He scoops up 52 sp but grumbles there would be room for a lot more in this coffin.

Sevaris is zooming around the basement. He finds a skeleton in another coffin, wearing a suspicious wooden mask. ~~Time for pillar men~~. A wrapped-up corpse lying on a bed of **seeds**. Seeds? Cormul vacuums up several hundred seeds. Mr Ruka triggers the DM's trap card, literally, as Krozzot steps on a **trap**. Statues spit fire at him! Yeah… maybe we should check for traps…

Meanwhile, Cormul, Sevaris, and me (plus Wobble and Smula, mainly Wobble as he is our front-liner now, was there ever anyone else? I can't remember) find a statue surrounded by 4 kneeling skeletons, and a blue **Corpselight**. Cormul suggests we do like with the dwarf and assault them, but not sexually. We start a blasting session, as Mr Chosen puts it. Sevaris definitely starts blasting, he starts casting ~~fairy fire beam~~ **Inner Radiance Torrent**. It's taking too long, so he blasts a skelly with **Exploding Earth**.

I step up and shoot at the skelly! **Critical**! Precision damage! I destroy it! And it explodes, blasting us with **Void** damage… Oh come the hell on. I shoot at another skeleton, and of course, miss. Back to business as usual, eh. Krozzot fell behind in another corridor and he is slicing at stuff, with very little success it sounds like. A skelebones stabs Wobble. The Corpselight blasts both the vegetable and the gardener with more Void damage, frightening them both.

Cormul casts **Boost Eidolon** and Wobble starts blasting (when did he ever stop?). The radish enthusiastically crunches on the bones. Animated or not doesn't matter to our boy. He crunches so happily, the skeleton is destroyed… and explodes. I pass the save this time, but both Wobble and Sevaris fail. Ouchie. Cormul moans at the skelly in the back (**Demoralize**). "Only 2 things are certain in life: death, and taxes. And you are already dead! Time to pay the taxes!" The skeleton is frightened.

Fairy time! Sevaris casts a **Thunderstrike**, big damage. I shoot once, hit! Emboldened, I grow greedy, shoot a second time… natural 1. You can't make this shit up. I retreat to hug Smula. In the distance, we hear a big crash! As if a stone gargoyle was just shoved down to the floor in vengeance by a grumpy orc, at a guess. Cormul gets blasted with **Harm** from the last comrade skeltal. Wobble retaliates. But the Harm spell healed one of the skellies, who gets back up!

Sevaris blasts the **Inner Radiance Torrent** he had been cooking up! I shoot the Arrow of Destiny (tm) on the damaged skeleton. Precision Damage! I hit it for like 19, it must have had 2 HP, tops. Sevaris and me get blasted with Harm in response, I burn a **Hero Point** and still fail the save but at least it's not a critial failure… I shoot the reanimated skelly, and predictably miss. It stabs me in retaliation. The fat of my belly! How dare you!

Cormul retreated into a corner to chug a **healing potion**. Sevaris chucks cantrips at the skelebones. It's too close for comfort, so I drop my bow and slice at it with my sword, at least that's the idea, I'm panicking and I just kinda flail. Krozzot tries to heal himself but it doesn't work out, he pops a Hero Point to reroll and… Critmeister Ruka strikes again! Natural 20!

The skeleton crits me. BIG OWWW. I'm near death, thankfully it misses the next 2 attacks! The group is already ~~roasting~~ burying me… Cormul uses ~~Vicious Mockery~~ **Bon Mot** on the skeleton, critical success! He is talking MAD SHIT to the bonepile. He is frightened. Sevaris does a fly-by healing on Cormul by dropping a potion on his head. It's funny until he does the same to me. Owwie! But I do feel a lot better huh.

I try to kill the skelly. I try so very hard. I call in Smula to finish him. 2 Hero Points later, he is still swinging, likely at me. Krozzot is still fighting ~~windmills~~ statues 2 corridors over. I get stabbed in the belly fat again, copiously. Thankfully the belly fat in question is also abundant, and I endure, bravely. Why am I tanking anyway? The Corpselight blasts us with Death Light. I burn my last Hero Point to save Smula's life, she goes from nat 1 to nat 20 on the save. You CANNOT make this shit up. I take full damage though and survive with the only HP that really matters: the LAST one.

Cormul blasts the skeleton to death with an **Electric Arc**. Of course, that makes it explode… I spent the Hero Point I just got to save Smula's life, again. Except I go from crit fail to crit fail and she still takes double damage… thankfully she survives, but I am down. All the belly fat in the world cannot save me from void damage, after all. My last thought is of cheese, and the frantic need to increase my belly fat, just in case.

I wake up to Sevaris pouring a healing potion down my gullet. I start saying I need more belly fat… then a massive crash echoes through the complex, like a big statue was just pushed over by a vengeful orc who had an entire training montage while we were fighting for our lives. At a guess, of course. I hug Smula for comfort, again. Krozzot shows up then, proud to have "defeated his ambushers". He patches me up while Sevaris is zooming around, looting.

**Loot**: 5 gold, 25 silver, Pendant of the Occult, Lady's Blessing Oil (Defiled), Dagger.

Wobble eats anything that isn't loot. Through narrow corridors, we get to a room full of bones. There is a hole in the wall; a small stream runs there, and some **plants** grow. With one proud nat 1 on Nature check, Krozzot confidently says… "it's grass." Cormul takes one look and goes like "you're full of shit, that's alchemical herbs". This summons Sevaris, who flies over and has a good look, along with a smell, and a little rub of the leaves. He also rolls a natural 1. Oh dear…

Cormul does find some Venus flytraps. We continue along the stream, but find nothing of note, so we turn back. We follow Krozzot and find 2 stone gargoyles, one tipped over and the other smashed to pieces. Cormul and Krozzot enter another room full of coffins. Sevaris, Smula, and me stay the fuck back. Cormul is engaging in some casual **graverobbing**, a regular Thursday. More wooden masks on skeletons… Cormul wants us all to wear them. Veto. Maybe Smula can ride in one.

Sevaris identifies some of his items, and Novator starts cursing at the DM. Huh! I'm sure that's nothing to worry about. Krozzot asks if I can identify the trap mechanism that triggers the (now ruined) gargoyles. I spot a small pressure plate. Cormul and Sevaris have their heads together, snickering. Oh, I don't like this…

We return to the **fountain** by the stairs we came from. Wobble jumps in and starts drinking the water, and he begins to glow white! Sevaris is flying around checking for magic. We return to the ground floor, still searching for the dungeon boss. We go to the big fountain in the courtyard and Wobble diligently jumps in, drinks… and glows white again! What a genius. But nothing seems to have changed…

We decide to stay at the manor for a **few days**, trying to riddle out its mysteries. It involves a lot of pouring fountain water over things, such as the glowing braziers, and the broken altar. Krozzot investigates the libraries. I try to find a pattern in the lamps; some went out, some stayed on. We examine each room for switches, levers, or traps. Krozzot treats all our wounds while Wobble carries fountain water on his leaves, dripping it on everything.

We discuss what to do in case other adventurers come by, looking for a friendly dwarf. There was never a dwarf here, what do you mean? Krozzot marks his territory, not by "pissing on the place, like a normal person" (says Cormul) but by dragging the gargoyle bits in front of the door. Sevaris tries to reboot the castle by turning all the lights off and then on again. He also looks for magic everywhere.

Certainly we can figure something out!

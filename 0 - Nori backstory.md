Nori lived a happy life in a warren on the outskirts of a small town. The community had taken residence in the ruins of abandoned buildings, and spread out in caverns under the nearby forest. The surroundings were peaceful, and inside the warren reigned constant, wholesome chaos befitting a very large family. Nori is unsure of who her biological parents are; like most children, she was raised by the community. Her many aunts tried to instruct her in the ways of trade, barter, and cooking, but Nori was an impatient and impulsive child with no gift for the art of commerce. She caused some trouble getting up to mischief with her many cousins, until her aunts no longer knew what to make of her. At a loss, they handed the energetic Nori over to the esteemed warriors of the Den of Fangs.

Within the Den, Nori's education was taken over by her many uncles. They taught her to sneak and stalk prey, to draw a bow, and to fight with short blades when necessary. There, Nori found her real aptitude. Her cluttered mind calmed when she ventured into the forest to hunt. When she drew her short bow, she was at peace. Hunting to feed the warren and keeping the community safe became her main tasks. She thrived in her role, having found a place where she fit.

One day like any other, as she was relaxing after a hunt, a strange tune resonated in the warren. As hypnotised, her many brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, looked up and started walking towards the music. Nori's paws moved of their own accord and she joined her family, following the song out of the warren, through the town and into the hills beyond. She danced to the pipes until her legs were agony, until her head spun and she eventually passed out from exhaustion. She woke alone and lost, and when she found her way back to the warren after a week of sleeping rough and surviving off the land, she found her home empty and cold.

Nori set out to find her family. She was accompanied by a young rat who had been cowering in the deserted warren, a last remnant of her home. She joined an adventurer's guild when she realised just how dangerous it was to travel alone, and just how small she was in this big world.

- Nori's main objective is to find her scattered family. 
- Her secondary objective is to find what magic led her and her community to become lost, and to discover who cast this spell and why.
- She will seek out other Ysoki communities to ask questions about her family, but is otherwise a poor communicator.

- Nori likes family and close friendship. Race doesn't matter, if she bonds with a person, they are family.
- Nori is sassy and impulsive, often preferring the company of animals over people if she doesn't know the people well. She is at her ease outdoors, preferably in a forest environment.
- Nori loves snacks, and cheese above all. 
- Nori's rat familiar is called Smula. She is a young female who tries to help Nori on hunts, with varying success.

- She fears being alone and lost again, and will pick companionship and danger over safety, if safety means being alone. 
- She fears the sound of pipes and flutes, but loves other music instruments.

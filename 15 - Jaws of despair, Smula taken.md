Our DM has been checking his map very thoroughly and has promised Quain a level up if he can find a hole in a wall. It is on, Cormul is zooming all over the place looking for a weak spot in the fabric of the universe and Sevaris is helping him.

The water quickly becomes deeper, Smula swims beautifully and I'm very glad for my **aquadynamic** armour. Wobble is blowing bubbles and Cormul is doing math on how long we could hold our breath. Krozzot frowns and ponders religious questions. There are tentacles flailing below, oh no. There are a lot of tentacles… I slap my lantern to make it work and we explore the place. "Three hypnotising balls and big boy shark," Krozzot calls out.

Sevaris is making theories about the potency of **fire and lightning** magic underwater. The universe is uncaring about underwater combat rules. We start doing math to pinpoint how far the monsters are, considering there is depth of water they are in. Cormul gets mad at me because I dared say Tony smells.

I crouch down into the algae and try to not be noticed, the sharks are too far for me to get a shot. Sevaris casts **Needle Darts** but it's a splash. He wants to set the water on fire but Krozzot dissuades him. The orc assesses the sharks' defenses and chucks his boomerang chakram, making the closest shark off-guard. This one swims up to us but stops short of our feet and Krozzot's boots.

Cormul **Demoralizes** the injured shark, poor fish. I could make shark fin soup after this… He casts **Guidance** on Wobble, and commands the radish to attack. He yells at Tony to blast with his pistols. Tony's aim is IMPECCABLE on the first shot, and dreadful on the second one. The big boy shark (?) wakes up and swims closer. I absolutely obliterate the nearby shark, don't know if we're making soup with that one boys. Then critically miss the next one. The dice giveth, and the dice taketh away.

Krozzot attacks a shark who gets mad enough to leap halfway out of the water and bite his legs… critical hit! Then it bites again and **grapples** Krozzot, who is now all bloody. Cormul intimidates the shark with **Demoralize**, what a glare, it's very effective. A boosted, hero-pointed Wobble slaps the shark nearly to death. We're all in a cuddle pile so our cloud ritual splash damage is going off a lot… Tony heals Krozzot by pouring the healing potion over him.

The big boy swims right up to us! It's a **very long shark**. "A shark that is long, a shlong for short," says Cormul. I command Smula to finish off the badly injured shark, but she is not good with underwater combat. I shoot the shark, but then the next one grabs Smula and **drags** her into the depths. My friend! I will hunt down that shark if it's the last thing I do!

Cormul gets super offended as Krozzot calls Wobble a **cabbage**. The halfling glares at the long shark, who is unfazed. Wobble crits ON CUE and nearly Wobbliterates the shark. Tony shoots at the big guy and sends it to the next realm! THAT IS MY SON, Cormul shouts. I jump into the water and swim at maximum speed, blessing my armour helping me float. I see the shark grappling Smula, she is struggling so hard the shark can't bite her.

Sevaris casts **Force Barrage** (legally distinct Magic Missile). Cormul casts Light on Smula, she is barely hanging on. I swim to Smula and feed her my healing potion. She still wriggles out of the shark's jaws, dodging all 3 attacks. Sevaris casts… **Torturous Trauma**?! That shark is not having a good time, serves you right for grabbing my rat! Tony shoots the shark and ends it. I hug Smula, then take out my knife and skin the shark. Natural 20! Revenge is sweet… I then swim over to repeat the operation on the long shark.

We also harvest a large quantity of meat on the sharks. Sevaris thinks to slice open the big shark's stomach and we find a **Scizore of the Crab** inside (along with some partly digested body parts, just a normal Thursday that). Using the same method, we find some gold coins on the other sharks. At the far end of the room we fought in, we find a tunnel with shallow water, and a magic symbol on the ground. Sevaris attemps **Read Aura** while Krozzot naturally rolls a crit on his religion check.

Krozzot's orc eyes see this is a circle for **communication** magic. Sevaris adds it can be activating simply by touching one of the pillars around it. Cormul touches one of the pillars and says "I want to speak to the manager. Moshi moshi, Cormul desu." A **Sahagin** appears and asks what we want. He is confused and asks how we got in here… and disappears as the circle's glow dims. I advise the casters to power up the circle with magic juice.

We decide to venture deeper into the dungeon instead, to try and find the Sahagin. Sevaris is zooming around the dungeon. We get into a tunnel with a deep **crevice**, and go another way. Cormul finds a hole in reality and shouts. We continue and find a hole with a lot of tentacles coming out of it. Yeah, nope. We find **ruins** over more rifts, and another glowing circle. The same Sahagin is here, in the flesh.

The Sahagin speaks about his clan **leader**. "He's rich, right," Cormul prompts. Sevaris asks about the leader's opinion on surface-dwellers. Cormul despairs, he does not have the R-pass. The Sahagin says this place is his home, and suddenly his people were no longer able to leave here. Outside the Sahagin cave were a lot of **shipwrecks**, clearly not what we saw outside the dungeon… Sevaris theorises dungeons are stolen from **alternate realities**.

The Sahagin does not know about dungeons, so Sevaris explains the concept and says we are in one of these dungeons. The fish-man thinks on it, that would explain why his **leader** has become distant and aggressive. Cormul tries to extort the Sahagin while Sevaris asks questions about their **magic circles**, thinking to use the knowledge for profit. Our fish-man will happily teach us the magic circles and follow us outside, but he would appreciate if we could soothe his leader.

"One more important question," Krozzot asks, "Are there any **carps**?" Cormul rolls his eyes, then asks about the **tentacles** everywhere, whether the Sahagin are into that stuff…? They're summoned for defence. We get directions to find the Sahagin leader and Sevaris estimates it would take him 2 or 3 days at least to learn the magic circle. Sevaris asks Krozzot to study the Sahagin to get an idea of his strength in battle. The fish-man seems pretty tough… Cormul asks if the leader is the strongest in the tribe, hypothetically of course. Yep, at least this strong if not more.

At this moment Sevaris thinks, hm it would be unfortunate if that leader was listening in on us. He tries to figure out by looking at the magic circle, but no luck. Before we leave, fish-man advises us to not touch the **circle** in the ruins and just head for the doors; it's another defensive measure. We follow the directions to the leader, look at the circle without touching it and uuuuh… we're not too sure what would happen if we touched it so let's not.

We continue through a winding tunnel to more ruins. We see more Sahagin and politely say hello. They reply with "Outsiders? Perfect. Get them!" We roll initiative. Krozzot immediately overcaps on Hero Points by rolling too high on **Devise Stratagem**. First-world problems… Then he crits again and slices a Sahagin nearly in two with the chakram. Sevaris casts **Telekinetic Projectile (Piercing)** and… also crits?! He hurls his alchemist's fire, roasts a Sahagin. I finish off the first guy, it's looking good so far.

The leader forces a **Will save** on Krozzot, who passes it but still gets frightened. Cormul sends in the Wobble and tells Tony, Slayer of Sharks to start blasting. The Sahagins try to harpoon Wobble but he feints with his leaves, what a pro. Tony is blasting, we could invest in better weapons for him. Krozzot casts **Guidance** on himself and Sevaris casts a 2nd-level **Horizon Thunder Sphere**, using all 3 actions to channel his brains out. ~~BEEEEAAAAAAAM~~.

I shoot the big guy! Max damaaaaaage! Then miss the second shot of course. Cormul tries to intimidate, natural 1. Wobble whacks but not enough, gets harpooned a little bit for his trouble. Tony is reloading his cannons. Sevaris blasts off the thunder sphere, BAM!! The leader dies, I fire THE ARROW OF DESTINY at the last underling and the fight is won! The dungeon wobbles and shakes! We loot expeditiously, grab the friendly fish-man, and leave.

We level up to 5!

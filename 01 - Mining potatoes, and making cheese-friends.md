I arrive in Port Leon and take a room at the Golden Hole inn. The next morning at breakfast, my ears pick up rumours! An adventurer whose team lost a member, he is giving out information about a dungeon. I'm all for the information. Maybe leads? Smula and me go. I meet four other adventurers there.

- One Halfling man with a trusty hoe, and a trusty lack of shoes. He carries a crossbow. - **Cormul**
    
- One Fairy? One MALE fairy. With his nose in the air regarding cooking, he is an alchemist in a blue robe. Approves of the Halfling's lack of shoes. - **Sevaris**
    
- One Orc, not green but black/grey. He carries a shortsword and chakrams. I saw him reading books at the inn. - **Krozzot**
    

They want to eat my rat. Nobody touches my rat.

We enquire about the dungeon. It's a hole in the forest, covered up with rocks and marked with a sign. The adventurer is uneasy, says something in the dungeon is off. It's dark and torches don't manage to light up the entrance, but the first level is lit. He heard dogs scratching at metal. An abandoned mine? Could go quite deep. Cormul says that's boring, and Krozzot says you don't know, people could be mining potatoes in there. They start arguing about the mining of potatoes; I side with Krozzot. Maybe if you dig deep enough, potatoes would appear? You never know.

Sevaris pulls out a map and asks the adventurer to mark the dungeon. Our man requests we look for the missing adventurer. He is lost as in not found. Not lost as in dead. Well, we don't know for sure. We question the adventurer on abandoning a teammate and trapping him inside the dungeon. He seems scared and jittery, possibly traumatised. He is uncomfortable, as well he should be. Krozzot gives him the eyebrow, but learns nothing more.

Our adventurer man is human, carrying a two-handed sword. He wears a green cloak. He marks a spot on Sevaris' map. It's not so far; Cormul says we'll be back for dinner, maybe second dinner. The adventurer says we absolutely should not sleep in the dungeon. We will see what he means when we get there.

I like Cormul. He likes cheese. We speak about snacks. He understands how the world works, he does.

Sevaris asks if we are all ready to leave. We have our gear and nod. We need money for cheese, after all. Maybe inside the dungeon I can find a clue to the piper, or my lost family. If the dungeon feels "wrong", maybe it is connected to the piper's unnatural magic. Worth a look.

After we exit the inn, Cormul whistles. After a few seconds, a cacophony of things falling and getting knocked over reaches us. A potato-sack sized radish joins us. Cormul introduces him as **Wobble**, clarifies that he is not food, and that if he is nibbled on, he will nibble back. He's been known to eat PEOPLE?! Sevaris flies up, frightened. I bow to the radish, very courteously indeed.

We set out for the dungeon. Sevaris is looking for ingredients on the way, from the vantage point of Krozzot's head. We come to a forest and Krozzot leading, as well as Sevaris, spot the pile of rocks we were looking for. We remove the rocks; the hole is pretty sizeable and goes straight down. We can't see a thing, even those of us with Darkvision. Could be a black-painted circle on the forest floor…

We send Wobble down, and Cormul jumps in after him. Sevaris floats down. Krozzot and me jump in as well. It truly is pitch-black in there. There is rubble below our feet, and all we can see is the blue symbol signalling a dungeon. Cormul calls out to Wobble; he waves his leaves close by.

This is our first dungeon. Total darkness is not unheard of. Cormul goes forward, wherever forward is. Krozzot turns his back to the blue symbol and begins to walk. Sevaries flies to the blue symbol and sees some kind of mine tunnel beyond. Krozzot falls upward and gets spat out bum first onto the forest floor, then comes back in. So this is how it works. Cormul says we should get close to the symbol. Once we do, we can make out a tunnel ahead.

Cormul casts Light on Wobble. We hear water flowing, but see very little. Guided by the light of Wobble, we find a wall covered in runes. None of us can read them, but Sevaris recognises them as Necrol, the script of undead things. There is a ruined campsite, a cold campfire and makeshift sleeping bags (read: potato sacks). The fire has been cold a long time. By the wall, two braziers give off light.

I look for tracks, and spot faint traces leading south-west to the slope, then north-east where they disappear. We find minecarts containing traces of ore. Not potatoes then. Further ahead is an elevator, but we stray east to a wooden structure. Looks like a ~~break room~~ place where miners would sleep.

"Look I'm not racist, I have nothing against the diggers. I got a D-pass, don't worry about it." Mr Quain, 2025

Crates, barrels, shabby beds that have been slashed open, seemingly by a weapon. We go to the elevator. Krozzot and Sevaris look around a storehouse and a raised platform, but find nothing of interest. The elevator mechanism is old but looks functional. The shaft looks deep. I fling a pebble down the shaft, but don't hear it hit the bottom. We get into the elevator and ride down.

There are some rocks glowing red. They look magical. Maybe they could fetch a good price… Cormul says it could be bloodstone. Krozzot picks up a discarded pickaxe to chip off a piece of bloodstone. To which Cormul says, "I could go for some chips." I agree with my bootless associate. Dungeoning is hungry work. Krozzot whacks the stone with a straight d20 roll, somewhat controversial for the month of June, and chips off 4 pieces before the pickaxe breaks. Sevaris attempts to replicate the effort with a shovel. It does not work as well and he only gets 1 piece.

Krozzot mines another 4 stones. We take a corridor to the east, go under a bridge, and find some skeletons. Wobble crunches on some of the bones before we can stop him. We find a ring of keys, which Sevaris snatches up. I take them off him, as he was struggling to fly with that weight. Cormul scavenges some coins. One of the stones looks very angry. We leave the angry stone behind.

As we head south, we hear canine growling and scratching against metal. Sevaris scouts ahead, on account of being tiny. Undead dogs up ahead? They seem very underfed. Maybe we can feed them to the radish. Cormul superboosts Wobble with Evolution Surge.

We roll initiative.

One Zombie Hound attacks the radish, unsuccessfully. The other two run up to the radish. Krozzot ponders how to kill the dawgs (scientific name, trust) with Devise Stratagem. He remembers their AC is 13! What a clever orc boy. He chucks his Chakri at them, but it's a miss. He tries with another one, but no luck either.

My paws shake on my bow, and my first arrow shoots way past the dog. The second arrow hits, and I take a few steps back. Sevaris casts an Electric Arc and zaps two of them, then retreats next to me. Cormul, very originally, casts Electric Arc and zaps them even harder. One of the dawgs fumbles the save and is deleted where it stands. Cormul commands Wobble to eat the injured dawg, but Wobble is not particularly hungry (must be those bones from earlier).

This entire party rolls 4s somehow. We've had like 4 or 5 in a row. Probably 4.

Cormul plants a TASTY crossbow bolt into the injured dog. He rolled max damage on a crit. The curse of bad rolls is broken?! The last dawg attempts a nibble on Wobble, but it's a critical miss! The second attack also misses. Mr Quain is a sorcerer IRL, confirmed.

Krozzot, with great feeling, throws more Chakri at the last dawg. It's a crit, and it takes big damage! I step in, and finish it off with a ~~pebble~~ arrow.

Cormul loots the dogs fast as fck, then we follow the tunnel to a flooded pit. We find barrels, dusty and empty, and down another tunnel Cormul finds a backpack full of mouldy adventuring supplies. The supplies are useless but the backpack is serviceable. Disappointed, Cormul feeds the whole backpack to Wobble, who is a happy radish.

We come across a chasm crossed by a very flimsy wood bridge. Sevaris flies across and says there are more dawgs. Nobody likes the look of that bridge, so we turn back. We find a small room full of weathered crates and some mining tools, which Krozzot picks up. We return to the room with the glowing bloodstone, which Krozzot mines enthusiastically.

Up north, we find a forge. To the west is a rotten barricade; it gives in to a kick. Beyond, we find a vault trapdoor. It's metal and stuck with rust. I pour some oil from my lantern onto it and we manage to force it open! A foul smell rolls out and hits me like a slap in the whiskers. Ew! Inside is a skeleton… wearing… glasses? Sevaris swoops in to grab the glasses, casting Detect Magic to check if there is any magic shullbit in the room. There is magic shullbit in the room. Sevaris grabs the glasses and looks through them, but they seem like regular glasses. In the effort to locate the magic, he takes the glasses out of the room… and senses no magic in the room! We theorise that the glasses are magical, so our magic boys, which is everyone except me, tries to figure out in what sense they are magical.

Sevaris says they are Clockwork Goggles that can grant low-light vision and filter some light types. Cormul offers to feed me herbs to cure my nausea, they taste nice but don't really help. We come to a long room lit by two braziers. In the middle is a pit full of bones covered by a net. Sevaris detects no magic here, just a lot of skeletons. We return to the elevator, planning to go down to the 3rd level.

But first, a mining break by Krozzot the Keeper of Rocks and Monies. When I bring up the lost adventurer, Cormul argues that we are here to make money so we can buy food.

We descend to the third level.

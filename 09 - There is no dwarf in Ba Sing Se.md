I have no idea why some lamps are on and some are off. Not finding traps or hidden shullbit upstairs. Downstairs, I find hidden niches and rooms containing **gold and valuables**. I stow them in the party stash, shinies make Cormul's eyes glitter so.

Wobble sprinkles **fountain water** everywhere. It toggles the lamps. Who's ever heard of an unlit lamp being lit by water?? That's not how lamps work. Or water. We don't manage to drain the fountain despite Wobble's considerable efforts.

Sevaris blasts everything with lightning, leaving scorch marks all over the place. He scans the place with **Detect Magic**, but only get 2 hits. He proceeds to _scour_ these two rooms for the magic tidbits. He tells us about magical dragon skulls.

Krozzot spends a lot of time reading, how very refined. He also takes a good look at the cracked altar in the basement; it is part of a ritual to **create undead**. Normal stuff to him. He finds a **notebook**, also in the basement, written like a diary. It ends on a hurried note about being attacked by skulkers in the woods.

I show my own notebook to Cormul, where I've written his best quotes albeit with a healthy amount of confusion. Tax evasion, how to sell items well (but not to friends), the wonders of a tax-free house. There was never a dwarf. He is very proud.

Sevaris' plan for the dragon skulls.

1. Investigate for magic
    
2. Physical violence
    
3. ???
    
4. Profit
    

Truly a plan we can all get behind.

Krozzot helps. He thinks the dragon skulls are infused with a curse that will be triggered if the skulls are broken. Cormul is still wearing the wooden mask. Surely that isn't also cursed, right? Krozzot gives it a long look. Ruka rolls a crit, of course. It's a **Skittering Mask**. Krozzot asks Cormul if he is afraid of insects. Not really, he just hates those that get to his vegetables.

Krozzot makes theories about the journal he found. **Two journals**. One about people in the forest, the second about creating undead. He assumes the first writer was from before the time the castle was a dungeon. The second writer, he thinks, could have been involved in the castle _becoming_ a dungeon.

Seizing the means of production is shullbit. Thank you, Cormul.

Everyone is the same on the sacrificial altar, says Krozzot. Cormul and me give him a thousand-yard stare. Krozzot-core.

The ghosts upstairs come back the next day, along with a new addition: a **dwarf**. How strange. There was never a dwarf here. We slap them for the hell of it. Oddly, the scorch marks from Sevaris' spells don't disappear from the magical auto-clean of the manor. The ghosts want us to join them, I'm sure that's nothing to worry about.

We decide to climb up to the **roof**, and NOT push Wobble off it. The next best option is to start digging in the courtyard… From the roof we see a forest in the distance. It's only been night here, since we arrived. Pretty stars! We wonder if the dungeon boss maybe is in the forest… But when we go to the forest, we hit the infamous invisible wall.

We are stumped.

~~Mr Novator falls asleep possibly in a ditch with burning commander decks~~.

We go back upstairs and start looking under tables, finding only dust. I suggest we light the braziers **simultaneously**, so we plan and split up to do that; Sevaris and me east, Cormul and Wobble west, and Krozzot down in the courtyard between the two rooms. We try our plan, but see no effect in the throne room. We kindly send Krozzot to the basement and repeat the operation, hopefully something happens downstairs? But turning on the braziers puts the magic barrier back up, so we turn them back off shortly after.

Krozzot reports that when the barrier was up, the **air** in the basement became thick, and he could not hear a **sound** despite trying to make noise. He says we should try it one last time, with Krozzot checking in the room above the throne room if anything happens. Well nothing of note happens. We repeat the process several times with Krozzot checking other rooms, but no luck.

Cormul and Sevaris decide to turn off the braziers while Krozzot and myself go down to the basement. We plan on searching the basement **while the barrier is active**. This is a little scary, but we have Smula. Turns out Cormul is a **Prescient Planner** and had an hourglass this entire time! Better believe it. We go on a massive tangent about hourglasses and decide this one takes 10 minutes to empty, but has marks on the glass for every 2 minutes.

~~Mr Novator wakes from strange dreams of braziers and hourglasses~~.

The air goes heavy and silent. The fountain is shining. We check the coffin, it looks the same (opened and empty). Everything looks the same… We find **lit candles** around a gargoyle. They weren't lit before! Naturally, Krozzot pushes it. I shimmy out of the room and watch from the door. After a few tries the gargoyle budges slightly, so the orc claims, but it doesn't fall. He **extinguishes** the candles, but nothing happens. So he lights them again.

We go to the stream, still without finding anything. We walk along the stream and see a light ahead of us, hovering above the water. We follow it, until Krozzot signals to me to stop. The light eventually comes towards us and passes us. Krozzot chucks his chakram at it, ~~rolls like shit~~, hits it… and the light attaches itself to the chakram as it falls to the ground. Krozzot picks up his weapon and the light attaches itself to him! Then goes out. (He gets a new item.)

We return to the corridors in the basement, and sound returns as Cormul and Sevaris deactivate the barrier. The candles by the gargoyle are **unlit**. We go back upstairs and Krozzot shows off the **Bioluminescent Stripes** he got. Our orc boy is glowing bright now. Cormul asks if the glow is some kind of parasite. Krozzot seems a bit bothered by that but he can't recall ever reading or hearing about anything like that. Cormul wants to pour some fountain water on him, but Krozzot goes ahead and dips himself in the fountain instead. Nothing happens.

We decide to **leave**, and see if anything traps us inside. But no, we can leave and come back in.

We are truly stumped.

I bet it's really simple. It has to be terribly simple and we are missing something GLARINGLY obvious. We try to move the 3 asymetrical statues in the throne room. It takes a long time, the thing is heavy, but eventually Krozzot makes it do the old 360. Nothing happens…

Cormul gently places one of the **dragon skulls** into the fountain. Black smoke peels from the skull and disintegrates. Cormul thinks there must be a market for cursed dragon skulls. He goes to light one of the braziers, and from the door, chucks another cursed dragon skull into the brazier. Mr Chosen begins to do math. Oh no.

The skull lands in the brazier, cracks, and **black smoke** peels from it and flies towards Cormul! He takes a huge sniff of the smoke, rolls a Fortitude save, gets an intense feeling of **dread**… and then it's gone. I'm sure everything is fine, Cormul looks the same as ever. He goes to sit on the cracked throne, nothing happens.

"Krozzot can you turn yourself on and sit on the throne?" - Cormul

Well nothing happens. We go downstairs. Sevaris places a rat **statuette** on the altar, whispers a few words to it, and it turns into a real, live rat! Then he stabs the poor thing. It squeaks and squirms and bleeds. Then Sevaris turns it back into a statue.

The boys put a lot of **body parts** on the altar. They attach to one another, forming a little zombie guy. ~~Tinybones~~. Well Cormul is adopting him. He wants more little guys, and potentially a big guy.

"The government doesn't want you to know it, Krozzot. But undead are free!" - Cormul, of course.

Krozzot tries to use ~~Nori Jr~~ Tinybones as a compass to the dungeon boss. He is confused. So are we, little guy. So are we. We take the little guy outside the dungeon, fully expecting him to crumble to dust! But nothing happens to him. Cormul hugs him, crying, "I'm so happy you're still here!".

We decide to wait for the ghosts to **respawn**, and pour fountain water on them. Cormul wants to play the **piano**. The party discusses the benefits of an undead workforce. I need emotional support. My face cannot possibly get any more palmed right now.

We spend two more days in the castle, playing the piano and teaching Nori Jr the basics. The ghosts come, and we sprinkle them with fountain water. They immediately turn to ash. The mysterious dwarven ghost does not recognise us. Why should he? Like the others, he says "More have come to join us." After we sprinkle them with water, the ghosts **don't return**.

Cormul has Nori Jr place a dragon skull in the brazier so he can be similarly cursed, bringing them closer as a family. They both go out and see the window in the tree wobbling, a sign the dungeon is **closing**! We all go out.

Getting rid of all the **undead**. That was the solution. There was no boss. But since we CREATED an undead, we prevented the dungeon from closing. I sit my ass in the grass and watch the dungeon disappear as Cormul falls to his knees screaming his loss of the tax-free castle, his free real estate.

We decide to drop by the dungeon labelled "**Elementals**" as it's pretty close by, before returning to Port Leon to sell our loot and confirm the closing of the "Friendly Dwarf" dungeon. There was a dwarf? I must have missed that.

We decide to not name our undead goblin Nori Jr, because it will cause confusion. Cormul doesn't like the name Tinybones. Sevaris suggests Bony, but it still has an obvious connection to undeath. I suggest, **Tony**. Close enough, and if you know you know. Tony it is.

Well, Cormul and me return to Kratin to get some assistance. I feel a disturbance in the Force, like Sevaris is talking shit behind my back. He would never… would he? It distracts me enough that I take a wrong turn and we end up lost, again. First roll of the night, **natural 1**. You can't make this shit up, I'm channelling the Wil Wheaton dice curse at this point.

We eventually make it to town pretty grumpy after the long detour and argue about how many people we need to drag or carry the ship. How much does she even weigh? Is it rude to ask? Cormul asks a policeman (I mean a guard) for help, as they are always willing to be of assistance. We make our way to the **docks** and look for muscular people with nothing to do. It's really crowded so I stand on Smula's back to see above the crowd. My rat eyes see a group of gentlemen just talking in between jobs and we go this way.

The moment Cormul mentions money to them, five heads snap our way and we get questions about how much. The Halfling explains our boat-on-ice situation, one of the lads shouts into a warehouse "Send dudes!" and a bunch of wide-shouldered men of various races come over to us. Cormul happily hires them, promotes one guy to lead them, and instructs them to get some supplies to haul **Marlene** off the ice. I ask around to get an idea on how much to pay our guys… standard dock hauler wages are between 1 and 3 gold a day. I suggest to Cormul to pay them well so we can make a good reputation in the city. He agrees and buys some alcohol to make them work better.

After way too many jokes and mental images of seamen, we meet up with the workers who have gathered tools and logs. I somehow lead them back to the **Ice Fields** without incident and we find Krozzot and Sevaris waiting for us. Krozzot says something about sacrifices and Sevaris looks up from making ice sculptures, he is surprisingly skilled… but why does this lady not have arms? Did Krozzot talk some cult-y shit into him? Why are there about 100 rat statues in the distance??

We explain it away as Krozzot and Sevaris being artistic. Cormul says R is not a letter he would use there, but I get to, I have the R-pass. The dudes shrug and start working so fast and efficiently, even Cormul admits they might deserve their pay. Sevaris has been brewing up a **suspicious blue potion** which he just distributes to the workers. The ship ends up on water a lot faster than we thought possible and the dudes request their pay. Cormul pays them and gives a lot of booze as well, which makes them very happy. Usually they have to pay for the alcohol themselves, how thoughtful. They return to town already half-drunk while Sevaris ominously calls out "Have fuuuuun!".

I'm sure nothing bad comes out of that.

We happily get on our new boat and Krozzot charts a course for Port Krazak. Marlene is surprisingly fast and we end up at our destination in the middle of the night after about 12 hours. We drop anchor and get some shut-eye thanks to Sevaris casting **Alarm** all over the ship without a care in the world. ~~No wild magic surges is a mood~~.

We sail into port early in the morning; the place is crowded with dwarves and Cormul starts ranting about diggers and gold. I get teased about not walking on my feet so I backflip off Smula's back and land neatly on my paws. There's **cannon** shots in the distance so we start enquiring about what people are shooting at. Cormul asks a dwarf who says "It's just **weapons testing**… new ammunition, better cannons, we've got dummies around the city to try them on." They're not preparing for war, it's just business as usual, they enjoy inventing new weapons.

Cormul is now paranoid about getting our boat stolen so Krozzot volunteers to hold the fort. We discuss selling the boat but decide against it, at least for now. We wonder if "**digger**" is a slur. I sneak into a bar and shout IS DIGGER A RUDE WORD then drop into a crouch and hide as they all turn towards me. After a minute, I slip out unnoticed and rejoin Cormul and Smula. Sevaris flies behind me and I ask him, were the drunken dwarves upset when I said the D-word? He says "nah, they were smiling". I glare at him, the corner of his mouth twitches, he is bullshitting me.

I conclude "digger" is probably a rude word and we shouldn't throw it around. Cormul also bullshits me so I go back to the docks to check on Krozzot. Cormul and Sevaris investigate shops that deal in valuables, no doubt to scam a poor merchant into buying our **figurehead**. They find a guy and walk back to the ship with him, passing by food stalls on the way. There is a lot of seafood on offer, a whole grilled squid, even some snake skewers.

Krozzot is happy to teach me how to draw various ritual circles and pentacles, and talking about sacrifices. Our guy suspends himself from the front of the boat to look at the figurehead, and after some time asks to be pulled up. None of us have much strength so Wobble slurps up the rope like spaghetti. The man is willing to buy the statue, however he claims it's not made of **solid gold**. Cormul and Krozzot double check, but it seems he is right.

They argue back and forth on the price and value of the figurehead, how sellable it is in its current state, profit margins… We're not getting a very good deal so Cormul asks to get in touch with an artisan who would buy the statue to melt it down. Krozzot starts talking about religion and making offerings to the gods; it would make a fine sacrifice to **Abadar**. Cormul nearly has a fit, you don't give something without anything in return! Krozzot argues divine favour is the return, but Cormul is not convinced. He storms off grumbling about diggers and crime, looking for an artisan who wants to buy raw materials.

We try to extort God, it does not work out. We argue about the price of gold and iron, whether the statue is just gilded, what do other gods (read: dungeon masters) think? We end up selling the statue for **2000 gold**, two **experimental cannons** on our ship, and a crate of food for Wobble, which is gone by the time we return to the ship. The food is gone, not Wobble. Wobble is here, looking very pleased with himself. Cormul is crying and cursing the gods and the diggers.

Well, now our ship is armed, sort of. Sevaris joins the grumbling about diggers and Krozzot takes the helm to get the hell out of here. I liked it here… We sail back to **Port Leon** with all haste, taking only 6 hours to reach our destination. Krozzot "stables" the ship, making sure it is well-fed and kept groomed while we are away. Cormul argues that's evil (he can do it himself, look at Tony). I roll my eyes and follow as we go look for dungeons to make even more money. We do still need to build up our business in Kratin and fund our **botanical experiments**.

Sevaris suggests transporting cargo between Port Leon and Port Krazak on our big ship. Cormul says we should get **zombies** to do it. Krozzot grumbles people will not like zombies. Cormul cries out he would like zombies. We pay for upkeep of our boat, each of us pitching in 20 gold to the dockmasters to keep the boat for **4 months**, in case something happens to us while we travel over land.

We find adverts for some dungeons:

- "**Prison**", in the middle of Lake Aerinth south-west of Port Leon.
    
- "**Volcano**", in the jungle straight south of Port Leon, across the lake.
    
- "**Spider**", high up on Far Rock north of Port Leon.
    
- "**Traps**", north-west of Port Leon is still up, no one has cleared it…
    

We decide on Prison, then Volcano.

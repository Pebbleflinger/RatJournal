Standing by the ice pillar with pictures on it, Cormul casts **Summoner's Precaution**. We lay our hands on the pillar… and find ourselves aboard a ship frozen in time. I hop on Smula and go looking for the ship's name as Sevaris flies up to the crow's nest and starts shouting in pirate language. I lean down the railing and spot the ship's name: **Marlene**.

~~We are on a boat named Marlene, captained by no one we can see and therefore not easily bribed.~~

There is a guy floating over the immobile sea to starboard! He's the guy who spoke shit to us in previous dungeons and called us all rats. Not looking at us just now… Sevaris wants to **catapult** something at him, and Cormul agrees and requests the something be Wobble. We hesitate, I suggest talking, and Wobble and Tony hop off the hip onto the sea. They sneak closer to the guy and Wobble… bares his fangs!

We roll initiative. Critmeister Ruka gets a natural 20, totalling to an initiative of 33, what even the fuck. Krozzot immediately rolls another 20 on **Devise Stratagem** and I nearly choke on my tea as the die comes to a stop. He then rolls another crit with the **Returning Chakram**, dealing spicy damage (and also splashing Tony and Wobble due to our questionable blessing). Krozzot tries to assess how badly hurt the guy is… pretty bad, halfway dead. Krozzot sees… he can cast **Fireball**!

Sevaris casts Heat Metal as our Ruffian is wearing armour… but he crits on the save, avoiding the spell entirely. I mark him as my Prey and draw my bow for a **Hunted Shot**… and that's 2 misses. One last try… critical miss. Okay fuck this game. I sulk on Smula's back. Cormul talks shit and crits him with **Demoralize**, frightening him. Wobble gives him the old nibble. Tony follows Cormul's order… "Blast his head off!" Tony executes his **Bullet Storm** and the opponent rolls a crit fail on the save, causing him to be murdered by Cormul's undead son.

As the armoured guy dies… **swarms of crabs** crawl up the side of the ship, led by one massive crab next to me! Yikes! I still remember that crab we ate once, this will be a feast! Slurp… Our dinner crawls up onto the deck, offering themselves up to feed us, how nice of them. Krozzot **Guidances** himself, then chucks the chakram at the big crab, getting it off-guard for me. He then rolls a nat 1, restoring the universe's balance.

The big crab crawls up next to me, and retracts all its limbs into the shell on its back, bracing for an attack. Sevaris does some thinking, if he casts Fireball on the ship, will it catch fire? He's not sure so he decides to go for **Horizon Thunder Sphere** instead, rolling a crit! He rolls shit on the damage but it gets doubled and wipes out one of the swarms.

My turn! I ride Smula away from the crab, make it my Prey, nock a **fire arrow**… natural 20! A second attack for Hunted Shot… and I roll absolute ASS on damage. Don't care, I got my hero point, I'm happy. Cormul tries to **Demoralize** the crab, it does not speak Taldane so he commands "Wobble, eat his ass." The radish obeys, reaching up from the sea with his very long leaves… and it's another natural 20! Tony reloads his guns as Wobble pre-chews our crab dinner.

The small crabs swarm me! Smula dodges most of the pincers, and I also dodge expertly. ~~What are mounted combat rules~~. We both take minor damage. Mr Ruka eats the math by rolling his 3rd nat 20 in like one hour. Cormul takes damage from the pincers and is **bleeding**. Krozzot slices the crab up some more, but it's a big bag of HP. It comes out of its shell and crabs on towards Krozzot, granting Wobble an attack of opportunity. But then the crab snips at Krozzot and **grapples** him! Somehow I get blamed for it because "step in fire, DPS higher" and I set the big crab on fire temporarily.

Sevaris fights the temptation to cast **Fireball** on us all. Barely. I could already see my new character sheet… Another **Thunder Sphere** then… and another crit! That's a second swarm wiped out. Mr Chosen tries to turn the big crab off and then on again. It does not work out. Sevaris' spells broke the token. DM spawns in a new token, I roll ANOTHER NATURAL 20 to hit, 2 pew pews with Hunted Shot and I delete the thing from existence. I try another arrow point blank on the swarm next to me but they crab-dance out of the way.

Cormul casts an **Electric Arc** on the last swarm but fails to take it out, splashes onto both of us rats though. "That's fine I have the ultimate healing combo now. _If we survive this fight_ I can get us to full health," says Krozzot. Yeah… the fact that you had to specify the condition says a lot… I get crabbed three times, burn a hero point to get Smula to dodge and we again take minimal damage. ~~Death by a thousand cuts~~. Krozzot rolls another 20 on Devise Stratagem, then rolls YET ANOTHER NATURAL 20 on his attack. HOW. HOW IN THE FUCK.

That takes care of the last swarm and a treasure chest appears at the prow of the ship. I rush to open it but get told to wait, as it will probably cause the dungeon to close. Sevaris zooms past me to do a Titanic over the water. Krozzot is patching up Cormul and Sevaris asks the voice in his head about cauterising wounds. We spend an hour receiving Krozzot's ministrations, he is now quite the accomplished medic!

We go loot the Ruffian's corpse. Close to him, time is gradually unfreezing, the water begins to move, the sails flap in the wind. Krozzot drops the anchor. We find an Unusual Longsword of an unclear nature on the guy. Krozzot gives it a look… it's another **Smoking Sword**! We grab it then start discussing how to get the ship out of the dungeon. I start collecting crab legs, which is easy for the small crabs, but less so for the big crab so I draw my sword and start hacking at them. Krozzot is fishing, Wobble sitting next to him with patient adoration in his eyes.

We examine the bad guy but… he's just a human, without any identifying signs. No crest on his armour, no tattoos… just the Smoking Sword. Cormul goes to search the ship itself; it has several cabins with worn beds, crates full of low-quality cannonballs and broken cannons. I find a small kitchen belowdecks and get to cooking dinner. Sevaris casts an **illusion** spell to make the walls wobble, causing me to rush out in panic. I find the wizard in a barrel of water he heated up to bubbling, just having a bath as Wobble is trying to sip the wizard tea.

We eat a crabby lunch then prepare to open the treasure chest. We all exit the dungeon except Sevaris, planning to get the ship out of the dungeon if we can. We tie a rope to one of us and exit the dungeon to see what happens. The rope goes into the crystal, but doesn't seem to be attached to anything. Well… How to drag the ship outside of the dungeon… Sevaris insists it's possible to **get the ship out**, despite the portal being much smaller.

We try to push a crate outside the dungeon, and that works. We theorise we might have to take the ship apart to fit it through the portal. Sevaris flies into the distance, and finds only more water. Krozzot maneuvres the boat around while Sevaris hovers next to the dungeon entrance, marking the portal's location. The wizard pushes the boat along with a **Gust of Wind** spell, then flies down behind it and readies a **Crashing Wave**. Krozzot is at the helm, Cormul and me left the dungeon, trailing a rope through the portal for our friends in case something bad happens.

The ship speeds into the portal… and it goes through! We **loot** the treasure chest; a Trollhound Vest, Bagpipes of Turmoil, Bracelet of Dashing, Shell of Easy Breathing, Berimbau, and Azurite. I call dibs on the **Bracelet**. Our new boat is next to us on solid eyes, tilted to one side. We decide to get the ship on the lake water and sail to **Port Leon** to sell it, it's too impractical to get it to Kratin.

Cormul is particularly interested in the figurehead, a statue with a trident which appears to be solid gold. ~~We are breaking the economy again~~. We decide to split the party, me and Cormul return to Kratin to hire workers while Sevaris and Krozzot watch over Marlene. With the workers, we get the boat onto the lake and sail to Port Leon where we look for more dungeons. We also discuss going to **Elandel** or **Krazek** for… sightseeing. We could sail to Port Krazak! Cormul isn't too keen on staying there, "where the diggers are".

Cormul is **selling** most of our loot, with his customary silver tongue and friendly manners. He does carefully avoid the one adventuring store we went to before, where the owner was not too impressed with his talking skills. I'm trailing after him, taking notes. Ambush people by giving them surprise presents. You never know what is in the box. Don't cry, Cormul. I go buy some **arrows** (mundane ones for when my fire arrows run out) as Cormul negotiates for "spicy bullets as a birthday gift for my son". Krozzot adds "on his first day of school". And this is why this game can never be streamed on Twitch, boys.

I sell my **Clockwork Goggles** for 3 gold, not doing any of the talk-works Cormul excels at, but that's okay. I spy a **Hunter's Bow** I desire, and ask Cormul to borrow some money. He says because I am his favourite apprentice, he will lend to me with no interest! Gasp. The perks of being Cormul's ONLY apprentice… Cormul buys a **Striking Rune**, I'm sure I can slot this into my bow.

Sevaris does ~~goblin things~~ fairy bullshit and makes the DM angry. We gear up our son Tony. Can't have him dying… again. Krozzot is now debt-free! I have a shiny new bow that does more than one sad d6 and instead… 2d6! I sell the old bow, after extracting the potency rune and slotting it into my **Shortsword**. I don't use it a lot but just in case.

Sevaris buys the recipe for the **Elixir of Cheese**! Oh no… We look for adverts for new dungeons. The one for the "friendly dwarf" is gone before we even get there. Was there ever a dwarf? We rip off the "elementals" flyer, since we cleared that dungeon. Krozzot bought a suspicious pendant, and put some boots on Wobble. I'm sure that is nothing to worry about.

We find new adverts:

- Sounds like a **ritual**? - far to the east, beyond Port Krazak
    
- **Underwater**, fish creatures? - across Lake Aerinth, just west of the Ice Fields
    
- **Dragon**??? - in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, north of Kratin
    
- **Church**? - on the west shore of Lake Aerinth
    

Sevaris makes my cheese slither out of my hand while I'm eating it. He's watching me chase down my snack with a shite-eating grin. I throw the magicked cheese-slime at him. "Food on the ground? A new challenger has entered!" Wobble appears and makes a dive for the cheese. We vote on which **dungeon** to go to, and Sevaris animates an ENTIRE WHEEL OF CHEESE to make it walk around. You monster… Wobble has acquired a taste for cheese (don't blame him, for once) and chases the walking wheel of cheese.

The boys do not want to sail the safe route by Port Krazak so we chart a course passing north of the golden city **Aerinth**. We plan to sail all day, then sleep on the boat once we reach our destination, and drop a net into the water to get some fish to appease Wobble.

Sevaris wakes me with a large sponge-like figure made of cheese. I can't even eat it… I need to figure out my revenge on the fairy-man. Nothing of note happens during the night but Krozzot's net brings **6 fish and a crab**. All the fish is fed to Wobble as I wrestle with the crab and cook it. It's really delicious! Krozzot mutters I should stay in the kitchen.

I lead the way into the mountains… and I get lost and lead us in a big circle, nearly back to the boat. Sigh. I HAD ONE GOOD ROLL AND I SPENT IT ON A CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB. On the second try, I get it right and we find the spot marked on our map. We look for the **dungeon** while arguing about the freedom and hairiness of feet. Even Wobble and Tony are looking! Such teamwork, wow.

Krozzot and me find a spot where the air is undulating like a desert **mirage**… so I've heard anyways. Desert sand is too hot for rat paws. I take out my **rope**, tie a noose, and throw a lasso at Sevaris to grab him and drag him close. He squeaks in panic as I hold him on a leash like some kind of magical balloon. He casts a Mystic Armor to keep himself alive and glittery in the dungeon. We walk into the mirage; the mountains fade around us and we find ourselves… on a **platform** in the clouds! Four other platforms surround ours about 40 feet away, on which **robed people are chanting** in a language we don't know.

Sevaris mumbles a few words and another **rat** appears beneath us. Cormul says something ratcist again. Krozzot feels right at home despite being up in the clouds, it's the ambiance you know? He does a big think. He supposes it's a ritual to imbue someone with power. I ask politely if the chanting people speak rat language, but get no answer. Our orc thinks the "cultists" will **sacrifice** themselves to imbue US. If we do nothing, the **ritual** will be completed.

Panic.

We figure out the language they are chanting in is **Auran**, the language or Air Elementals. Krozzot does a big frown, in the last dungeon we were in he saw the symbol of **Hshurha**, a neutral evil deity of storms. ~~Suddenly Russians~~. Krozzot wants to stay until the ritual completes, without disturbing the chanters. As I'm questioning Krozzot, Sevaris flies in circles around me and I only notice when the rope tightens around me. He tied me up like a roast for the oven! Sevaris bribes me with the **Elixir of Cheese**. I am a good rat. We wait for the ritual to complete.

An hour later, the chanting stops and storm clouds form above us. The cultists around us fall as we are hit by **lightning**. We choose to not resist the lightning and somehow take no damage. Then everything starts to wobble as the dungeon **closes** and we leave. Well, I am made to leave as Sevaris flies at mach 2 dragging me after him like a tiny dog dragging its owner. Krozzot figures out we are now blessed (?) by the power of the storm. Our attacks now inflict 2 points of splash damage!

Sevaris shoves the Elixir of Cheese into my pocket as I wriggle, still tied up. Krozzot convinces Sevaris to untie me so I can **scout** the way to the next dungeon. The wizard says he will burn the ropes, so I threaten to chew through them and he unties me normally.

We level up to 4!
